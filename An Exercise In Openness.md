# An Adventure in Openness

Hey there! I'm CJ. I left my job last Friday to pursue creative software work full time. I don't really have a specific project in mind. But I do have a set of values that I deeply care about and want to express through my work. I sincerly hope that my work will live up to these values. I am putting them out there 



### I believe in a lot of things, so let's get going.



#### Love



I think love is one of the most fantastic things on this planet. Why? To me love represents something so beautiful. It is inherint in the word and concept itself. But to me it is this. Love is the thing that universally bonds. Every one of us has an immense capacity for love, and I think today this capacity is being underutilized. The times seem more divisive than ever. But why? We are the most connected we've ever been but the most separated. It doesn't make sense. It seems that the platforms we have are not always being used for the right things.



We like the blame the other side. But it's not only their problem. It is also ours. We can't be blind to our own faults. It is the faults that are human. The faults that bond us. This is the human condition. This is what love is to some extent. It is accepting the faults of yourself and others. There is always going to be fault in this world, but at the end of the day we are both human and both deserve respect. I believe everyone is born inherinitely good. Perhaps this is too optimistic, but it's very rare I meet someone with ill intent. Even if I disagree with their point of view, I try to listen and try to understand where they are coming from. It is from this mutual understand that I can still love and respect them. I am not perfect at this but I believe strongly that with more love in the world we would be much better off.



To love every single person is hard, but that is not a reason we shouldn't try. Every one deserves to tell their story and have it heard and respected.



You know I think with enough love, we truely can achieve world peace. What an achievement it would be. I think a lot of people don't believe this, but if you don't try it will never be possible. I prefer to think that world peace can be achieved and strive towards that even if we fail. Really I think it is only a matter of time.



#### Individuals > Corporations



We live in a strange society right now. Often times it seems money is more valuable than other human lives. It is hard for me to comprehend this, but I guess I need to do more research myself. To better understand why this could be. But regardless, I believe strongly that individuals matter more than corporations and profits. If people are suffering at the hands of a corporation we have done something massively wrong. That should be a clear re-evaluation point. I think also the same thing goes for the planet. We can't have this kind of short-term profit driven thinking, without considering any of the side-effects. Of course we can't be too pessimistic, but we can try to be realistic. There is only so much we can ever know at any point, but it is on us to try to project the best we can, and do the best for ourselves and our children. 



#### On Being Open

This is all about being open. Open with my ideas, open to new ideas, sharing my beliefs and myself as a whole as I can. This terrifies me. But I know there is not much to be scared of. I could look massively stupid. I could essentially set $70k on fire with nothing to show for it. But I trust in myself to do better.



Why being open? It just seems like the right way to go about things. What I mean is I love love. I believe that by being open it's easier to give and recieve love. That is something I whole heartedly believe in and desire. Beyond just love, I mean there is so much to give by being open. I hope I can teach. I hope I can share my failures, my mistakes. Things to do better next time. There's an absolute treasure trove of information to be shared. Intellectual property is nice and all, but I'd rather you build upon what I know. I want you to expand on whatever I thought and make it better. My thought is not the end all be all. Even I am continuously revising them. If I wasn't then I am not living. So please. Help to build openly for all humanity to do better. We are in the best time ever, but we still have so many problems to work on. Let's solve them together. I don't need to keep secrets for a dollar. It seems silly to me. Maybe I'll go broke with this mentality but I don't believe so. Even by being open there are ways to live.



I think it would be good for society as a whole to be more open with data. I think right now data is treated fundamentally wrong, it's so closed for the most part. As companies try to keep their data close as it is why they are so valuable. But this is silly. There's so much more benefit to be had if we could easily communicate across data sources to solve problems. Maybe there would be less profit margin, but would it be worth it? What problems can be solved? What connections across disciplines can we find?



#### And so much more to be added.

presence, community, deep connection, data, expression, sustainability, education, equitability, freedom, people are equals.



### How to live up to these values?



I think this is all to say there is a lot of work to be done to best adhere to these values. Here are some of the things that already fit into this model, or are in the pipeline. 



- Continously publish
  - (What I am learning) (What I am working on) (What my goals are) on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis to start.
  - As I am thinking and working. Seamless experience. 
  - Be open about my direction. Always
- To open source all my work
- Radical transparency
  - I'm putting $70k on the line here, and I will make my financial data public
  - To have a publically queryable database (note some things will be private still)
  - Algorithms as transparent as possible (sources of data & manipulations of it)
- Organize groups of people holding similar values, expand on these ideas and bring them to life



### Okay cool, but what are you going to build?

Honestly I don't know yet. This is very much a creative journey which will follow my values. My hope is these values seem to hold up for other people as well, and ultimately what I create can help them.

In an attempt to be more specific, transparent, and open. I think initially what I build will be a framework to work effectively in public and better maintain interpersonal relationship. What is success then? I'm measuring success not by my reach, but rather by the number of deep & meaningful interactions I can have. I think this will be a lot more fufilling and help to drive what's next.

### And there's much more to come

I expect to fail in some way on a daily basis but that's the best thing I can hope for. That means I learned what not to do next time. I hope to uphold these values as best I can, and I would appreciate any feedback on how I am doing and what I could do better at. I really only scratched the surface here as there is so much nuance to everything. 

Please reach out to me if you found any of this interestesting. I'd very much like to talk to anyone who shares these values, or believes differently. I'm sure either way it would be fascinating.





# Other version



Hey there! I'm CJ and I'm on a mission to be open and transparent with everything I do. I left my job to do this. But I guess before getting started you must know one thing about me. Technology has been my passion since I was a kid. This is something that has never left me and I don't think ever will. Everyday I see the wonderful things being built around me and want to contribute to that. We exist in a world with a digital playground. A sandbox with endless possibilities. It's time to be a kid again, play, and share the fun and do so in a meaningful way.

It's time to be a kid again, play, and share the fun and do so in a meaningful way. 



## Why this mission of openness?



### The Universal Power of Love

I think one of the most basic elements of love is mutual understanding and respect. I think from this, anyone and everyone can be loved. But it is up to you to try. 



In the context of openness and transparency, a lot of problems seem to go away when you try to understand someone else. I think mutual understanding is one of the most basic elements of love. I think sometimes we forget that we are all human and the majority of us really are out here to do good. For our families and our communities. Being human is the universal condition we all share, and it's something we can all bond over. At the end of the day I expect that you hold a different opinion than I do, and that's a good thing. But out of mutual respect for eachother we have to listen. 



That's not to say that screaming is an effective form of communication, but I think if everyone was a bit more open, it would be clear someone's background. It would be harder to take someone for granted given what they've been through. By being open it allows for us to peek inside someone's world and get to know them at a deeper level. I don't think the power of this can be discounted. 





I know that by being open I will be accountable. That is if I put something out there whether to a friend or to the public, now there is some level of investment. Some motivation for me to do that thing. For me atleast I have seen it works tremendously well. It's an extra kick in the pants.

I believe that being open and transparent , but why is this? I guess the core question would be, why is being open and transparent valuable? 

I believe by being open and transparent we can learn from each other quicker and understand each other at a deeper level. Easily able to get a better view of someone and what they stand for. These two simple things seem to have so many downstream effects.

## Working, Building, and Creating in Public

This is my first attempt to work in public[^3], and I hope it can outline some values and principles to hold myself accountable to. 



On one hand I am terrified about the prospect of this. I am probably going to look dumb a lot, but that's okay. I am until I'm not, and that's just got to be learned. On the other hand I'm excited. I love technology and I love people, and I'm excited to share my take on the intersection of the two through what I can build.



* Open source all the things
* To publish my finances. I have $70k to work with[^3]
* To have a publiclly queryable database of everything I create
* Have documentation, 
* Transparent algorithms
* Systems 



## Okay cool, but what are you going to build in public?

Honestly I don't know yet. This is very much a creative journey, and one that I hope will benefit others. What I do build should flow from these values. 

Initially what I build will probably be a framework to work effectively in public and maintain interpersonal connections better. What is success then? I'm measuring success not by my reach, but rather by the number of deep & meaningful interactions I can have. I think this will be a lot more fufilling and help to drive what's next. 

## And there's much to come

I am not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. I expect to fail in some way on a daily basis but that's the best thing I can hope for. That means I learned what not to do next time. I hope to uphold these values as best I can, and I would appreciate any feedback on how I am doing and what I could do better at. I really only scratched the surface here as there is so much nuance to everything. 



[^1]: I need to pull in more supporting evidence for this claim. Specifically I've read/listened to a few things about this, but in a coming revision this will need to be updated to include them. Definitely Hidden Brain there was an episode about this, but need to dig for it as it has been a long time.

[^2]: This will later be structured much differently. Would like to have individual pieces for each value I hold, written in an [evergreen fashion](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes), much like Andy.

[^3]: [Andy has a wonderful collection of notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=Work_with_the_garage_door_up) on this topic and was a major inspiration for my own journey. I'm going to go about working in public in a few ways.
