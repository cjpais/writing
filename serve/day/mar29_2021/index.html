    <h1>Monday, March 29, 2021</h1>
<p>So far an interesting day. Tried to get some surfboard shaping space at
Maketory. Will have to see if this works out, there is a shipping container
that could be a good space perhaps for even two people. Will have to see.
Hopefully the price is good.</p>
<p>On another note, started working with GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression)
to analyze expected AirBnB prices in Berlin. This eventually will be targeted
for estimating rent prices across San Diego. However I will say it seems like
the expected price as outputted by the regression is quite off.</p>
<p>From what I can tell it is giving almost all weight to the geographically
close neighbors, but not taking into account the other important features.
I am not quite sure how to correct for this yet. This is something I would
like to discuss with Kevin and see if he has any insight that I do not. I
am also curious if I can naively do some kind of ensemble technique and see
if that helps or not.</p>
<p>I have a feeling I will have to spend a lot more time with the data to get
something meaningful out of it. I was hoping the machine learning techniques
would reduce the search space dramatically. I think that it should, but I
don't have the right insight into the problem or the space yet to really
grasp.</p>
<p>I am thinking about taking a break from this problem and instead moving
to finish up the Elixir challenges on 1729.com. At the worst I learn
more about Elixir and the best case I also win $100 of BTC.</p>
<p>Hmmm okay.</p>
<p>Well Elixir is proving to be more challenging than expected.
Doing the Diffe-Hellman key exchange was trivial once I understood
the syntax for dealing with <code>Binaries</code>.</p>
<p>Basically a <code>Binary</code> is something in the format <code>&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</code>. Every element
within the braces will be a uint8. So you might get <code>&lt;&lt;124, 213, 20, 42&gt;&gt;</code>.
This would be a <code>Binary</code> containing 4 bytes.</p>
<p>Suppose I wanted to interpret this as two uint16's. I can do the following.</p>
<pre><code>iex(1)&gt; &lt;&lt;i1::integer-unsigned-size(16), i2::integer-unsigned-size(16)&gt;&gt; = &lt;&lt;124, 213, 20, 42&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;124, 213, 20, 42&gt;&gt;

iex(2)&gt; i1
31957

iex(3)&gt; i2
5162
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly I could interpret this as an int32</p>
<pre><code>iex(4)&gt; &lt;&lt;i1::integer-size(32)&gt;&gt; = &lt;&lt;124, 213, 20, 42&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;124, 213, 20, 42&gt;&gt;

iex(5)&gt; i1
2094339114
</code></pre>
<p>Dealing with multiprocessing is much more challenging for me. I am not quite
caught up with all the techniques in general. Plus I am still relatively
unfamiliar with the syntax which is making it even more challenging.</p>
