<h3 id="toc_4">Color Scheme</h3>

<p>Decided to go for a <a href="https://coolors.co/eeff77-ee77ff-77eeff-000000-ffffff">CMYK Color scheme</a> - Reminds me a lot of printer colors. Thought it was fun and maybe retroish. Maybe just plain ugly, but I think it&#39;s cool. I was just playing around with 3 digit color codes starting at <code>#fff</code> and changing a couple of numbers. After I found a color I liked (<code>#ef7</code> was the first one) I just took all the permutations of the 3 characters and picked the ones I liked. Likely this is going to get expanded when I need to make graphs.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Raining Emoji Background</h3>

<p>For displaying my financials I thought it&#39;d be fun to spruce it up with some flying emojis in the background ðŸ˜„. You can see the effect I am going for at <a href="https://burrito.place">burrito.place</a>. I ended up using <a href="https://github.com/matteobruni/tsparticles">tsParticles</a> which is a JavaScript library which seems to handle this kind of thing quite nicely. It allows you to specify images for the particles as well. I used the <a href="https://iconify.design/icon-sets/twemoji/">Twitter Emojis from iconify</a>. The performance seems acceptable to me. However I can tell it is tough on machines. My MBP always spins up the fans real fast. I am guessing there is some GPU rendering or something that is not entirely optimized. </p>

<p>Before ending up on this library I tried a few approaches. Initially I tried to use pure CSS since I thought it would be a performance advantage. It definitely is possible to get it to work, but I thought the performance was bad. In particular I saw a lot of frames skipping. The code to accomplish it was also quite ugly. Once I realized how ugly it was going to be, realized JS was probably going to be the way. So next I tried JS, and found <a href="https://codepen.io/robertheiser/pen/NXrqXa">someone doing something very similar</a>. At first I thought this was perfect. But I played with the code for a bit and realized man the performance was not so good once the page started to rollover. So I ditched this too. However I kind of like this javascript one still, its&#39;s almost more fun and means there is not code dependency. I might end up switching back to this. Let me know what you think.</p>
