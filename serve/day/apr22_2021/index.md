## Programming Education

Thinking a little bit this morning about what a curriculum for teaching kids
how to program would look like. Specifically something that is fun and
encourages them to keep learning more. 

For me how I learned most of my programming and computer skills was
through Minecraft. I think this is something that could still be a
valuable teaching tool today, and hopefully keep kids engaged as
well

I have some skills I would want to focus on.

* UNIX
  * basics: cd, ls, cp, mv, nano/vim, ssh
* Programming
  * Variables
  * Loops
  * Conditional Logic/Boolean Logic
  * Interfacing with API and Documentation

### Initial Thoughts

#### UNIX

I think one way to learn UNIX would be to set up a minecraft server and have friends
join. And then start to do more complicated things like add plugins to the server
and things like this.

#### Programming

Explainations of:

* Cloud Architecture
