I had a random idea hit me this morning. I was watching a shaping video from
Tanner Bedheim and thought of some new art I might want to make for my
surfboards. I keep having these ideas and needed to note it down. Naturally
it went into the projects directory. But seeing that file made me see my
inspirations again. This is something I've been on about for the past
couple of days. I saw at the end of Tanner's video his instagram, which
is probably also awesome just like Matt Kinoshita's. However I don't use
Instagram a lot because it doesn't really work for me. With this said
I realized I wanted to have a feed collection. I want to organize my
feed collections however I want. If that be by domain, great. If that
be by something else, great. I just want a way to start categorizing
feeds so I can see them in one place so I can stop going fucking crazy
everytime I pick up a computer. So I can use these different platforms
to capture my interests not in one jumbled feed, but something more tailored
to really what I want to see. 

Sorry this is not very cohesive, my mind is all over the place right now
and just trying to get some things down before I start to go off.

At the end of the day I am thinking about writing a feed aggregator. 
It should handle

* YouTube
* RSS
* Twitter
* Instagram
* FB
  * Groups
  * Friends
* Podcasts

So let's get going.
