Okay okay okay OKAY. Good morning so far ;)

Some good work done immediately as well which is sweet. Completely accurately predicted
the time to complete some work (2 hours on the dot!)

This was working to get the backend of the feed aggregator (wavy-waveface) to handle
creating personal feeds from a collection of other feeds. It also needs to handle
serving these feeds back to the front end after they are created. It also needs
to list all of the personal feeds you have.

So I did exactly this. The second one was already completed yesterday but the rest
were this morning. 

The next piece of work was to send the request from the frontend to actually
create the feed. This also went smoothly. Since I had a bit of additional
time and already had the list of personal feeds, I added that into 
the sidebar. Sweet!

So now before we take a break I want to fix the problems with YouTube feeds
that I am having.
