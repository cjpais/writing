<h2>WTF Intersection</h2>
<p>Dave mentioning money that is not used deteriorates in value. This is
very similar to something Curtis mentioned on our phone call. &quot;you
have x dollars to help someone, if you don't help them the money
goes away.&quot; This feels like a very interesting intersection.
I feel like it gets to some core incentives which are fascinating. I
am not quite sure what to make of it yet, or understand really what
this means, but I am sure curious.</p>
<h2>Podcasts</h2>

<p>Listening to this podcast was very interesting. Calacanis thinks quite differently than I do.
This is certainly expected. There were a few interesting
tidbits in this podcast I feel.</p>
<p>One was the mention of the tension between changing the world
and work life balance. It seems to really change the world
you almost have to go full in on your work. But I don't
like this or think this is healthy. Why is it that the
world is like this? Is it just because the person who
works the most is going to outwork everyone else? And in
that case they don't have that balance? Why do we
incentivize this? Is this even healthy? To me it seems
like it would be a lot healthier to have more balanced
people coming up with balanced long term solutions.</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-tim-ferriss-show/id863897795?mt=2">Apple Podcast</a></p>
<p>Well I know I for sure bookmarked the shit out of this
podcast but it was mainly for a single reason. That was
because Chris Sacca was dropping some knowledge. One thing
that stuck with me was his mention that the old school computer
scientists were way better in a lot of ways. That the new generation
of computer science students have had it much too easy. Going into
college knowing the degree is very valuable, and not having that much
outside life experience to go along with that degree (traveling to
other countries, working different jobs). I
believe he makes the point that, now, people have very narrow perspectives because they haven't needed
to go out and see the world since they could easily get a job and buy a
house. That this has led to a lack of empathy in the industry in general.
I find this fascinating and agree, and recognize that I am very much in
this same position. Yes, I've gotten more life experience than most
other engineers I know, yet, I haven't seen anything. He also
mentions people trying to build products for people they don't even know
or understand. Again this resonates with me, and something that I need
to work on more. Build on an informed and emotionally informed basis. Freaking loved this.</p>
<h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CejJ2aVRUE8">Lex Fridman Podcast #157â€‹ w/Natalya Bailey</a></h1>
<p>One thing I absolutely loved from this podcast was her mention of the
cost of ion engines in NASA days vs now and how low you have to go to
compete with SpaceX. Something like 3 or 4 orders of magnitude cheaper.
I guess my perspective on this was maybe it is good for the government
to take care of things for a certain amount of time, and then let
capitalism take over at some point. I feel maybe this could be the way
with healthcare. Let the government take it, and if you want to compete
the government has set the bar you have to beat. Now do it orders of
magnitude better and improve outcomes across the board.</p>
<h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3Umo_jd5AA">Lex Fridman Podcast #166 w/Cal Newport</a></h1>
<p>This whole thing is worth a listen if you ask me. However this podcast
inspired me to ask a few questions so wanted to note them down.</p>
<p>One thing was Newport mentioning something about what if we pay for
social media? I think this is a very interesting idea and personally
I would love to pay for social media if it can provide me an experience
worth paying for. What would that experience be? Well I think something
that is not addictive. I want to get genuine and deep updates from people.
I am not sure exactly what this means, but something more than just a
photo. However this immediately raises the question for me, do we want
people spending even more time thinking about social media??! Anyway, I
certainly want to hear your long form ideas. I also want to be able to
separate out more cleanly, digital connections and physical ones. The
things I might want to share between the groups might be mightily
different. In general this brings the idea of sharing to different groups,
which I think Google did in Circles back in the day. But I really think
this is a great idea. I would love to see just certain information from
certain groups some of the time. I might want to consume different
information in a concentrated, intentional way. So I can actually focus
on that topic relatively deeply and engage with the material.</p>
<p>Beyond paying for social media, I think there was a mention of what web
2.0 really means. It has turned out to be walled gardens, antithetical to
the spirit of the Tim Berners Lee's vision for the Web. I do wonder if
we through Web 2.0 have now found abstractions all the platforms use and
can develop a protocol for them to have better interactivity between platforms.
I think the bigger question is here, how does this benefit the person using
the platform relative to today? What does the difference in interaction look like?
How is it 'better'?</p>
<p>A big part of the podcast was also focused on E-mail. That we spend so
much time kicking the ball back and forth without making progress. I guess
in general I just don't like to worry about needing to kick the ball back.
Rather I don't mind needing to kick the ball back as long as it means
making progress on something. But I've found (at least in my previous job)
E-mail doesn't really make any forward progress. At least not in the same
way that a direct phone call with intention and purpose does. I guess however
this is all focused on productivity, which is not in and of itself the best
goal.</p>
