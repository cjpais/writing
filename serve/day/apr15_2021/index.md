One thing I just noticed. I've had ideas and let
them go by without doing anything about them.
Well in particular GitCoin, I think this
is something I'd been talking about for years
when I first learned of Ethereum. However I had
it in the context of a much larger system. 
Maybe this is something to think about. 
Don't need to think about the whole system
all of the time. Sometimes you can take a piece
and execute directly on that. Maybe this is less
elegant (and I think it is) but ultimately the 
results can be achieved. Is that such a bad
thing? I think not. So then I think the question
is for me. What is my most specific idea? 
Probably the LTE network. If possible to deploy
it really could be a boon. Maybe I really should
look into doing it at small scale and see what 
can be done. Regardless of the why. I think
it gives individuals more power and I think
that is good.
