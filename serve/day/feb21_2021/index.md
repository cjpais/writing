Reviewing some notes from the stream.

I think one interesting one to write about is from the Jason Calacanis.
He mentioned that to change the world you cannot have a work life balance.
I want to say I do not think this is a healthy or sustainable attitude for
operating in the world. I also think the basis of what he is saying is flat
out wrong. Perhaps this is true in the tech world, but what are we optimizing for?
I think Patagonia is a fantastic example of a company which is changing the
world, slowly, but surely. I think this is more the world I want to live in 
at the very least. Not a company on the wire, trying to follow trends, but one
who is trendsetting. Trendsetting without trying because it is the motivated 
by the right things. Not to inherently make money, but do good in the world
in a way that is lasting.

One curious notion I wrote quickly, was using Rust for a 5G software stack
after listening to Lex and Brandon Eich (created js). I think there was 
some interesting mention of Rust safety and race conditions which is 
instrumental in engineering a good 5G SW stack as far as I have seen. 
Two fundamental concerns that waste a lot of time. I wonder if something
like OpenAirInterface can be refactored into Rust.
