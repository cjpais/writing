<p>Feeling sick this morning, but I got this so that's nice :)
Really thankful to have Chiaki right now</p>
<p>I guess I'm doing some reading to catch up on all my notes
that I haven't taken a look at yet.</p>
<p>First thing is:</p>
<h2>Feynman's <em>Plenty of Room at the Bottom</em></h2>
<p>One thing I find interesting about this reading so far is
that to a large degree we have exactly what he is talking
about here. With digital we are able to etch an
enormous amount of information into a tiny space. However
as he notes, even this is massive compared to what he
is talking about. I guess it's really to say the beauty
of our world. That the entire universe is really capturing
an immense amount of information. We are just mere
travelers along the way. Just like this big ball of Earth
floating through the vastness of space.</p>
<p>He is about to get into DNA and I am also interested in
this space. I am not sure how I can contribute or have
ideas but I do thing it's quite fascinating.</p>
<p>Do Biological systems have autonomy? How do they
'know' to make proteins? Why does this happen?
How did multicellular life form? How did cells
form to begin with? What gave cells an advantage
in the world? Fundamentally these questions are coming
from Feynman. That cellular life is complex, DNA
perhaps is a store of information but it is
actively being acted upon. How and why did this
occur?</p>
<p>Interestingly enough Feynman basically outright predicts
Machine Learning, specifically in facial recognition.
A technique many of us use on a daily basis now.</p>
<p>Rest of the paper was interesting, and I like his
economic incentives at the end.</p>
<p>My brain is struggling to focus for any period of time right now.</p>
<p>I guess now we can go read:</p>
<h2><em>Meditations on Moloch</em></h2>
<p>So far enjoying the first 10 examples. However
education resonates with me the most.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People ask why we can’t reform the education
system. But right now students’ incentive is
to go to the most prestigious college they can
get into so employers will hire them – whether
or not they learn anything</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been</p>
