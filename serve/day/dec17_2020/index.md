Good climbing this morning.

Took me a while to get to my computer and get going, but it is what it is.
Now it is time to do some thinking.

One thing coming out of the shower is a long term project. The long term project.
The next internet. An incremental but important change.
Addressing the concerns:
* How do we provide universal access to the internet for free without censorship?
  * Paywalls? 
  * Just like buying a book from a store you might need to pay, but is this a cost too high for most people?
* How do people get paid fairly for content creation (music, video, etc)
  * On their own terms. 
* How do people live in a world driven more and more by technology
  * How can people be paid for having and contributing to a digital presence?
* How do we lower the friction of having an internet presence, being paid and paying. Make it easier than a credit card.
* How can the internet be used to bring together and create space for opposite points of view. Just to be heard, not scoffed at. 

Anyway. These are some of the long term things to think about and work on. This will be a piece coming out.
Perhaps in multiple parts, perhaps in one long. 

Thinking about the possibilities
