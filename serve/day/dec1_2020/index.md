Had some good fun today.

Was able to read a QR code in iOS as well as track it around a frame. Pretty neat.
Now would like to add some real AR experience on top of this. Is all 2D right now
and would like it to be more 3D I guess? Real AR is so much more interesting
than this, but this is also important.

Thanks to this SO post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45090716/arkit-how-to-put-3d-object-on-qrcode

Lots of digging through Apple's docs. Would like to experiment with mesh this week as well.

Have a few things I want to play with tomorrow

* Photogrammetry from the video of The Tower
  * Colocation for Nvidia GPU's???~!!!!
  * call geeks candy shop to see if we can get an nvidia gpu with cuda for cheap to use meshroom or whatever
  * break video into photos
  * Need to record accelerometer data in addition? Make sure they are only capturing at a certain speed?
* Finish making Mesa Rim QR Code Labels
* Automatically create days for this daily writing thing so I can stay sane
  * Think about next generation folder hierarchy 
    * (that can be organized in multiple ways)
    * that has dynamic routes
      * dynamic folders
    * really each day is a collection of attributes, and I might want to sort just based on those
      * i just want to look at the folder for today
      * i just want to look at this week
      * i just want to look at the past 7 days
      * i just want to look at 2020
      * i just want to look at jan 2020
      * i just want to look at jan, march, may 2020
      * i just want to look at my trips in 2020
      * every file basically needs some kind of metadata attached to it
        * then this can be used to generate web pages
        * even the same day can have multiple pages
          * one can even be a default page for the day with the link to everything in the day
* Write a cronjob to run brew update every now and then. Fucking hell.
