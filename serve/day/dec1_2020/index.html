    <h1>Tuesday December 1st, 2020</h1>
<p>Had some good fun today.</p>
<p>Was able to read a QR code in iOS as well as track it around a frame. Pretty neat. Now would like to add some real AR experience on top of this. Is all 2D right now and would like it to be more 3D I guess? Real AR is so much more interesting than this, but this is also important.</p>
<p>Have a few things I want to play with tomorrow</p>
<ul>
<li>Photogrammetry from the video of The Tower
<ul>
<li>Colocation for Nvidia GPUâ€™s???~!!!!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Finish making Mesa Rim QR Code Labels</li>
<li>Automatically create days for this daily writing thing so I can stay sane
<ul>
<li>Think about next generation folder hierarchy
<ul>
<li>(that can be organized in multiple ways)</li>
<li>that has dynamic routes
<ul>
<li>dynamic folders</li>
</ul></li>
<li>really each day is a collection of attributes, and I might want to sort just based on those
<ul>
<li>i just want to look at the folder for today</li>
<li>i just want to look at this week</li>
<li>i just want to look at the past 7 days</li>
<li>i just want to look at 2020</li>
<li>i just want to look at jan 2020</li>
<li>i just want to look at jan, march, may 2020</li>
<li>i just want to look at my trips in 2020</li>
<li>every file basically needs some kind of metadata attached to it
<ul>
<li>then this can be used to generate web pages</li>
<li>even the same day can have multiple pages
<ul>
<li>one can even be a default page for the day with the link to everything in the day</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
