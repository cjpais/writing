    <h1>Monday December 14, 2020</h1>
<p>Been mostly working on griefpal today. Just migrating everything to a new system (previous was a hacky ass script, needs to be updated now). Running a Google App Engine script when someone submits the form. This then hits a web server and adds it to a DB.</p>
<p>That is what I have done this morning.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>App Engine -&gt; POST to Server</li>
<li>Golang Server to receive</li>
<li>Set up SQLite DB</li>
</ol>
<p>Now will set up a couple endpoints. Then it will be to import the test data into the db and actually send emails out. If that is done today I would be stoked. That just leaves tomorrow to actually build a front end.</p>
