    <h1>Wednesday December 16, 2020</h1>
<p>Okay time to get started for the day.</p>
<p>Thinking about what we need to do it becomes a few things pretty quickly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Send emails once the group is formed (guess Iâ€™m spamming myself today)</li>
<li>Table for latest added users on the front page
<ul>
<li>This can be very simple without any sorting or business</li>
<li>Just needs to paginate (and have an API returning all people sorted)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Unmatched users
<ul>
<li>a table where you can select and filter users</li>
<li>want to find a good library for this and then style.</li>
<li>we are going to do this first</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

  </body>
