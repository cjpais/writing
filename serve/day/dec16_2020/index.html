    <h1>Wednesday December 16, 2020</h1>
<p>Okay time to get started for the day.</p>
<p>Thinking about what we need to do it becomes a few things pretty quickly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Send emails once the group is formed (guess I’m spamming myself today)</li>
<li>Table for latest added users on the front page
<ul>
<li>This can be very simple without any sorting or business</li>
<li>Just needs to paginate (and have an API returning all people sorted)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Unmatched users
<ul>
<li><p>a table where you can select and filter users</p></li>
<li><p>want to find a good library for this and then style.</p></li>
<li><p>we are going to do this first</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Need to do something to fix my goddamn shell. At what point do I just have a docker image which becomes my primary and forget about everything else. Seems like so much overhead but yeah. I don’t want to have a lot of dependencies when using a computer. It should just work and continue to work in any state.</p>
