Okay time to get started for the day.

Thinking about what we need to do it becomes a few things pretty quickly.

* Send emails once the group is formed (guess I'm spamming myself today)
* Table for latest added users on the front page
  * This can be very simple without any sorting or business
  * Just needs to paginate (and have an API returning all people sorted)
* Unmatched users
  * a table where you can select and filter users
  * want to find a good library for this and then style. 
  * we are going to do this first
