### Move to ZSH

I was using fish shell for a while, but I had a few niggles with it. The configuration for it is different than bash. It was tough for me to figure that out so back to bash like config. Also using starship with it slowed it down tremendously. 

### Move off of AWS

Was like $15 a month for a crappy tiny server with no space. Went for a $20/mo server with [Spin Servers](https://www.spinservers.com/). 8GB RAM, 2xE5-2680 Cores, and 200GB SSD. So far it is looking good. The network appears fast and able to handle 2500 reqs/sec relatively okay.
