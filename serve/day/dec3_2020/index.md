So for today:

* More QR codes
  * Good progress on this, have a bunch ready for boulder. 
    * Want to prune out ones I don't like. Probably put twitter to a vote?
      * Instagram?
  * Put labeled one on twitter for now

* Apple article. Writing round 2
* ARKit Point Cloud Generation and Visualization
* Directory structure and VSCode plugin so I don't go insane.
