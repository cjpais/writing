    <h1>INDUSTRY CHANGE YO</h1>
<p>We are just past a huge moment in the semi conductor industry.</p>
<p>Before M1 After M1</p>
<p>This is a demarkation. Why? What has the M1 shown the rest of the industry?</p>
<h2>Focus on Performance (raw perf, power, efficiency, heat) Metrics</h2>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p><strong>POWER</strong></p>
<p>Power puts everything in context.</p>
<p><strong>CPU</strong></p>
<h4>Vs. Desktop CPU’s</h4>
<h4>Vs. Laptop CPU’s</h4>
<h4>Vs. Mobile CPU’s</h4>
<h4>Vs. Desktop GPU’s</h4>
<h4>Vs. Laptop GPU’s</h4>
<h4>Vs. Mobile GPU’s</h4>
<h2>By Having Performance</h2>
<h3>We get</h3>
<h4>Consumers move towards apple</h4>
<h5>For the</h5>
<h6>Best price/performance</h6>
<h6>Battery life</h6>
<h6>That apple ecosystem</h6>
<h6>Maybe not the low end &lt; $900</h6>
<p>How much of the market is this?</p>
<h2>Industry Now</h2>
<h2>Industry Future</h2>
<p>Certainly more ARM. Possibility of ARM taking a huge marketshare. Requires response from AMD and Intel. Allows NVidia, Qualcomm and maybe more to enter a much larger market and potentially really transform datacenters and the consumer space. What does this mean for high performance gaming laptops? Will push the thermal envelope at the top end, and eventually these gains will trickle down again. We will continue to see better and better performance in low power devices, which will become more and more mainstream.</p>
<p>As we look to a future of AR, we require extremely low power devices to make this possible, yet with a lot of compute capability, or the ability to offload it to another device. Requires full realtime experience, which even ARKit is lacking in it’s current state. It is high performance, but we need methods to eek out every last bit (this is a tangent and a half)</p>
