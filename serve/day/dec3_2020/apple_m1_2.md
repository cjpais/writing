# INDUSTRY CHANGE YO

# Whats Next in the Post-M1 Era?

A milestone in the semiconductor industry.
A signaling point.


Before M1
After M1

This is a demarkation. Why? What has the M1 shown the rest of the industry?

## Focus on Performance (raw perf, power, efficiency, heat) Metrics

### Performance

So now that we have the facts on performance, what have we learned?

On the surface looking at the raw performance metrics it seems like

**POWER**

Power puts everything in context.



**CPU**

#### Vs. Desktop CPU's

#### Vs. Laptop CPU's

#### Vs. Mobile CPU's

#### Vs. Desktop GPU's

#### Vs. Laptop GPU's

#### Vs. Mobile GPU's

## By Having Performance

### We get

#### Consumers move towards apple

##### For the

###### Best price/performance

###### Battery life

###### That apple ecosystem

###### Maybe not the low end < $900

How much of the market is this?

## Industry Now

## Industry Future

Certainly more ARM. Possibility of ARM taking a huge marketshare. Requires response from
AMD and Intel. Allows NVidia, Qualcomm and maybe more to enter a much larger market
and potentially really transform datacenters and the consumer space. What does this mean
for high performance gaming laptops? Will push the thermal envelope at the top end, and
eventually these gains will trickle down again. We will continue to see better and better
performance in low power devices, which will become more and more mainstream.

As we look to a future of AR, we require extremely low power devices to make this 
possible, yet with a lot of compute capability, or the ability to offload it
to another device. Requires full realtime experience, which even ARKit is lacking 
in it's current state. It is high performance, but we need methods to eek out every last bit (this is a tangent and a half)

talk of 

will the rest of the industry try to catch up using unified memory arch?

super high performance workloads!? rely on icc

if you want more industry insight read the above lmao
