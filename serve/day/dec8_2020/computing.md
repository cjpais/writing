# Computing

Lots of notes from this morning video recording session.

For the Apple M1 thing I have a lot I want to cover.

Ideally would like to squeeze everything in 10 minutes, not sure if this is possible.
Will have to be extremely concise.


## M1 Video/Article Outline

### Intro

This will be something like the M1 is going to shake up the industry. Could be one
of the main turning points in the desktop computing era.

Purely focused on the CPU/GPU space. Maybe a touch on the TPU/AI, but this
can be saved for another discussion.

Initially the impact will seem small, but the future potential could be massive.

To understand why we need to take a look at history.

### Relevant History and Players

1. Birth of Personal Computers
  * Apple II
  * IBM PC - MS-DOS
    * IBM Struggling. Partnered with MS. Intel.
    * IBM Compatible PC's, cheaper. 
    * Huge success. Gaining 80% market share
  * **Significance** 
    * WinTel Born
      * Most people become familiar with Windows
    * x86 dominating enterprise and consumer spaces
2. Microprocessor Wars
  * Intel v AMD
  * Frequency wars
  * **Significance**
    * Focus on raw performance at the cost of power and heat
3. Multi-Core Processors
  * Intel Core (Core 2 Duo)
  * AMD K8
  * Apple switch to Intel from PPC
  * **Significance** 
    * Birth of modern laptops
    * Continued Intel dominance
    * Rise of efficient architecture
      * Shift to IPC/ILP/(Perf/Watt)
4. Smartphones
  * iPhone introduced 2007, based on ARM architecture
  * Powerful low power device
5. Cloud Computing
5. Zen
  * AMD taking Intel's spot as top dog in the CPU industry.  

### Where we are today

Things are changing much more rapidly today then they were previously. We could essentially summarize
the history in a few sentences.

## History of Computing

This comes in a few sections.
Need to highlight the significance of all of them, and then come back to why that is important today

1. Birth of the PC
2. Birth of the GUI ()

## Where is computing technology heading?

* Post Cloud Era
