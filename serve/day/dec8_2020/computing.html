    <h1>Computing</h1>
<p>Lots of notes from this morning video recording session.</p>
<p>For the Apple M1 thing I have a lot I want to cover.</p>
<p>Ideally would like to squeeze everything in 10 minutes, not sure if this is possible. Will have to be extremely concise.</p>
<h2>M1 Video/Article Outline</h2>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>This will be something like the M1 is going to shake up the industry. Could be one of the main turning points in the desktop computing era.</p>
<p>Purely focused on the CPU/GPU space. Maybe a touch on the TPU/AI, but this can be saved for another discussion.</p>
<p>Initially the impact will seem small, but the future potential could be massive.</p>
<p>To understand why we need to take a look at history.</p>

<h3>Where we are today</h3>
<p>Things are changing much more rapidly today then they were previously. We could essentially summarize the history in a few sentences.</p>
<h2>History of Computing</h2>
<p>This comes in a few sections. Need to highlight the significance of all of them, and then come back to why that is important today</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Birth of the PC</li>
<li>Birth of the GUI ()</li>
</ol>
<h2>Where is computing technology heading?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Post Cloud Era</li>
</ul>
