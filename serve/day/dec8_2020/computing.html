    <h1>Computing</h1>
<p>Lots of notes from this morning video recording session.</p>
<p>For the Apple M1 thing I have a lot I want to cover.</p>
<p>Ideally would like to squeeze everything in 10 minutes, not sure if this is possible. Will have to be extremely concise.</p>
<h2>History of Computing</h2>
<p>This comes in a few sections. Need to highlight the significance of all of them, and then come back to why that is important today</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Birth of the PC</li>
<li>Birth of the GUI ()</li>
</ol>
<h2>Where is computing technology heading?</h2>
