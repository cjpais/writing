    <h1>Friday October 16th 2020</h1>
<p>A nice slow morning. Meditation and just cleaning the house.</p>
<p>Time to read for a little and get back to RBG.</p>
<p>Took about an hour to write on <em>Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</em>. Made some good progress, but realizing some things about writing</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f6K1U6lH5Q">Whitney Cummings and Lex Fridman</a></h2>
<p>Another great podcast. Really fun to listen to and some interesting insight. Would like to come back to this podcast</p>
<h2>Thinking about Writing</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m realizing a few things about writing. So right now I have two separate places that I write. I use them for different purposes. This is alright but not great.</p>
<p>One is <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam</a> for longer form kind of things that take more time to write.</p>
<p>The other is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> for these daily files.</p>
<p>What I realize is that</p>
