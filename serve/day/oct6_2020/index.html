    <h1>Tuesday October 6th 2020</h1>
<p>Gonna be a busy day already.. Had to take care of a few things this morning related to insurance.</p>
<p>Discussing the Supreme Court with Bay after lunch, then climb at 2. Then lobster diving at 8:30</p>
<p>Was nice talking and catching up with Bay. Lot‚Äôs of things going on. Man she is writing on an extremely hard topic. I am very interested to see where it goes. Basically is about how do you restructure the Supreme Court to take the politics out of it!!! This is a huge topic and very interested to see how it progresses.</p>
<p>Climb was sick as always. I met Terry, who is also friends with Chris (an older trad climber who also shapes surfboards!?). Stoked on this. Hopefully go climbing outside soon.</p>
<h2>Plugin Architecture</h2>
<p>Trying to look into plugin architectures in general now. I think I was diving too far off the deep end trying to grasp what VSCode is doing.</p>
<p>So far:</p>

<p>I took notes on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRvm3zQQc1Q">this youtube video</a>. It so far provided a great description of plugin arch using Golang, but ideally can be used for a lot of different languages</p>
<h5>Sidenode:</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAAkCSZUG1c">Go Proverbs</a>. some nice things about go</p>
<ul>
<li>the interfaces are quite small in general
<ul>
<li>can reimplement them yourself and this is SOOOOO nice</li>
<li>build components that can be shared</li>
</ul></li>
<li>use 0 values if you can</li>
<li>don‚Äôt use empty interface <code>interface{}</code> if you don‚Äôt need to, dont need it as much as you think.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Patterns</h3>
<ul>
<li>Microkernel</li>
<li>Loose Coupling</li>
<li>Hollywood Principle</li>
<li>Memento Pattern</li>
<li>Dependency Injection</li>
<li>Observer Pattern</li>
<li>Mediator Pattern</li>
<li>Strategy Pattern</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other notes for moving forward</h3>
<p>So far RPC seems like the best thing to me. I will need to go and review about RPC. Definitely have used it before when implementing a <a href="https://github.com/kkuo42/CSE223B-FinalProject">distributed system</a> for school.</p>
<p>Might want to establish ‚Äòchannels‚Äô‚Ä¶ maybe similar to 5G. This can also be thought of as messaging interface. Wonder how much this kind of arch can be used as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>broadcast channel [pbch] (host -&gt; *) (* -&gt; * [????])</li>
<li>control channel [pdcch]</li>
<li>data channel [pdsch]</li>
<li>log channel [none]</li>
</ul>
<h3>TODO READING (TOMORROW)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>CodeMirror/ProseMirror</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin">Hashicorp Plugin</a></p></li>
<li><p>Microkernel pattern</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Also caught a lobster just under the size limit üò¢</p>
