Writing Space!!!!!!!!!!!

Spent a good part of the morning working on the VSCode Extension to automatically create days.
You can see how this went.

Now I am going to take a break from that and do some thinking.
Not sure where to put this yet.

  * Even things like the history are fun to research, and maybe more interesting on their own.
  * Would like to mix in opinions later. Where the industry is going. Where I would like to see it go.
    * Fun things that are going on. AR. AI, etc.
    * What can Apple do?
    * What is the future of the internet?
    * Better privacy?
