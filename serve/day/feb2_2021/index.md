Curious to know if it would be possible to give my phone a static IP address.
Seems it would be possible if I roll my own VPN and tunnel all my traffic
through that. Then I can have the IP consistently be the machine that is
the VPN. This would mean though, that when traveling or whatever the latency
of all traffic could be a fuck load given that it is all tunneled through
the VPN.

Anyway an interesting idea. Something that may want to be explored in the
future more. I really just want to be able to talk between devices directly
even if it is connected via a cell tower. I don't want to jump to servers
you know.

Maybe the bigger thing is to bake in authentication to my stream so no one
else can hit it, even if they were to know the paths.
