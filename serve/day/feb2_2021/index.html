<p>Curious to know if it would be possible to give my phone a static IP address.
Seems it would be possible if I roll my own VPN and tunnel all my traffic
through that. Then I can have the IP consistently be the machine that is
the VPN. This would mean though, that when traveling or whatever the latency
of all traffic could be a fuck load given that it is all tunneled through
the VPN.</p>
<p>Anyway an interesting idea. Something that may want to be explored in the
future more. I really just want to be able to talk between devices directly
even if it is connected via a cell tower. I don't want to jump to servers
you know.</p>
