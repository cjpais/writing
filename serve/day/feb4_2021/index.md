WEEEEE surf at Law Street was fun. Got crushed but always
a fantastic time. Leave with a smile and a great start
to the day. Fuck yeah.

Daniel conversation very good. Need to think about motivations
and decentralized architecture. CRDT's for sure. My brain is fried
and emotions all over the place.
