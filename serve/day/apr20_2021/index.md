## Beginning Climbing Recommendations:

(taken from conversation and put here)

### Shoes

I would definitely go for: https://www.rei.com/product/165183/la-sportiva-tarantulace-climbing-shoes

These are the shoes I started on and never felt they limited my climbing as a beginner, they also lasted a surprisingly long time. Definitely try to buy in person at REI, shoe fit is important, they should be comfortably uncomfortable, and will stretch a bit over time. They should be in stock since they are the most popular beginner shoe.

### Harness

I think https://www.rei.com/product/162868/black-diamond-momentum-harness-mens would be perfect. It’s the same harness I started on and it’s still kicking today and I use it in the gym

### Belay Device

Check if the gym you’re going to requires an assisted braking belay device, they might be more expensive, but I have some recs on both unassisted and assisted.

(add detail here...)

Unassisted: [Black Diamond ATC Guide](https://www.rei.com/product/149644/black-diamond-atc-guide-belay-device)
Assisted: [Petzl Grigri](https://www.rei.com/product/151970/petzl-grigri-belay-device)

### [Software Infra 2.0](https://erikbern.com/2021/04/19/software-infrastructure-2.0-a-wishlist.html)

How do we most effectively use servers which are running?
Something about architecture I believe in, and something that I'd 
be pretty curious to work on. I think AWS Lambda gets closer. 
But not quite.
Well maybe I need to understand more. I actually would be curious
how much of my API's could be run in lambda?

Can running on lambda and charging just above this get to some
closer transparent API pricing scheme? Having users pay for 
the true price instead of what I want to charge? Could lead
closer to fully sustainable tech. This could be something
to experiment with in wavy.

What if AWS ran on lightning network? Or some other crypto L2?

> Not just that, but multi-tenancy is actually truly a “free lunch” from a resource utilization point of view, so any opportunity to pool resources represents a true win-win bargain. At the scale data centers worldwide, it's big — it depends on who you are, but you could either get excited about the gigatons of CO2 saved, or the increased corporate net income margin (I guess I like both!)

A note about solid API's. Definitely something I care deeply about
and will need to think more about the API organization going forward
with wavy.
