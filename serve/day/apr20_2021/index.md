## Beginning Climbing Recommendations:

(taken from conversation and put here)

### Shoes

I would definitely go for: https://www.rei.com/product/165183/la-sportiva-tarantulace-climbing-shoes

These are the shoes I started on and never felt they limited my climbing as a beginner, they also lasted a surprisingly long time. Definitely try to buy in person at REI, shoe fit is important, they should be comfortably uncomfortable, and will stretch a bit over time. They should be in stock since they are the most popular beginner shoe.

### Harness

I think https://www.rei.com/product/162868/black-diamond-momentum-harness-mens would be perfect. It’s the same harness I started on and it’s still kicking today and I use it in the gym

### Belay Device

Check if the gym you’re going to requires an assisted braking belay device, they might be more expensive, but I have some recs on both unassisted and assisted.

(add detail here...)

Unassisted: [Black Diamond ATC Guide](https://www.rei.com/product/149644/black-diamond-atc-guide-belay-device)
Assisted: [Petzl Grigri](https://www.rei.com/product/151970/petzl-grigri-belay-device)

### [Software Infra 2.0](https://erikbern.com/2021/04/19/software-infrastructure-2.0-a-wishlist.html)

Something about architecture I believe in, and something that I'd 
be pretty curious to work on. How do we most effectively use servers
which are running? I think AWS Lambda gets closer. But not quite.
Well maybe I need to understand more. I actually would be curious
how much of my API's could be run in lambda?

What if AWS ran on lightning network? Or some other crypto L2?

> Not just that, but multi-tenancy is actually truly a “free lunch” from a resource utilization point of view, so any opportunity to pool resources represents a true win-win bargain. At the scale data centers worldwide, it's big — it depends on who you are, but you could either get excited about the gigatons of CO2 saved, or the increased corporate net income margin (I guess I like both!)
