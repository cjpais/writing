## Beginning Climbing Recommendations:

(taken from conversation and put here)

### Shoes

I would definitely go for: https://www.rei.com/product/165183/la-sportiva-tarantulace-climbing-shoes

These are the shoes I started on and never felt they limited my climbing as a beginner, they also lasted a surprisingly long time. Definitely try to buy in person at REI, shoe fit is important, they should be comfortably uncomfortable, and will stretch a bit over time. They should be in stock since they are the most popular beginner shoe.

### Harness

I think https://www.rei.com/product/162868/black-diamond-momentum-harness-mens would be perfect. It’s the same harness I started on and it’s still kicking today and I use it in the gym

### Belay Device

Check if the gym you’re going to requires an assisted braking belay device, they might be more expensive, but I have some recs on both unassisted and assisted.

Unassisted: [Black Diamond ATC Guide](https://www.rei.com/product/149644/black-diamond-atc-guide-belay-device)
Assisted: [Petzl Grigri](https://www.rei.com/product/151970/petzl-grigri-belay-device)
