<h2>Beginning Climbing Recommendations:</h2>
<p>(taken from conversation and put here)</p>
<h3>Shoes</h3>
<p>I would definitely go for: https://www.rei.com/product/165183/la-sportiva-tarantulace-climbing-shoes</p>
<p>These are the shoes I started on and never felt they limited my climbing as a beginner, they also lasted a surprisingly long time. Definitely try to buy in person at REI, shoe fit is important, they should be comfortably uncomfortable, and will stretch a bit over time. They should be in stock since they are the most popular beginner shoe.</p>
<h3>Harness</h3>
<p>I think https://www.rei.com/product/162868/black-diamond-momentum-harness-mens would be perfect. It’s the same harness I started on and it’s still kicking today and I use it in the gym</p>
<h3>Belay Device</h3>
<p>Check if the gym you’re going to requires an assisted braking belay device, they might be more expensive, but I have some recs on both unassisted and assisted.</p>
<p>(add detail here...)</p>
<p>Unassisted: <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/149644/black-diamond-atc-guide-belay-device">Black Diamond ATC Guide</a>
Assisted: <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/151970/petzl-grigri-belay-device">Petzl Grigri</a></p>
