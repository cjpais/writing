<h2>Beginning Climbing Recommendations:</h2>
<p>(taken from conversation and put here)</p>
<h3>Shoes</h3>
<p>I would definitely go for: https://www.rei.com/product/165183/la-sportiva-tarantulace-climbing-shoes</p>
<p>These are the shoes I started on and never felt they limited my climbing as a beginner, they also lasted a surprisingly long time. Definitely try to buy in person at REI, shoe fit is important, they should be comfortably uncomfortable, and will stretch a bit over time. They should be in stock since they are the most popular beginner shoe.</p>
<h3>Harness</h3>
<p>I think https://www.rei.com/product/162868/black-diamond-momentum-harness-mens would be perfect. It’s the same harness I started on and it’s still kicking today and I use it in the gym</p>
<h3>Belay Device</h3>
<p>Check if the gym you’re going to requires an assisted braking belay device, they might be more expensive, but I have some recs on both unassisted and assisted.</p>
<p>(add detail here...)</p>
<p>Unassisted: <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/149644/black-diamond-atc-guide-belay-device">Black Diamond ATC Guide</a>
Assisted: <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/151970/petzl-grigri-belay-device">Petzl Grigri</a></p>

<p>How do we most effectively use servers which are running?
Something about architecture I believe in, and something that I'd
be pretty curious to work on. I think AWS Lambda gets closer.
But not quite.
Well maybe I need to understand more. I actually would be curious
how much of my API's could be run in lambda?</p>
<p>Can running on lambda and charging just above this get to some
closer transparent API pricing scheme? Having users pay for
the true price instead of what I want to charge? Could lead
closer to fully sustainable tech. This could be something
to experiment with in wavy.</p>
<p>What if AWS ran on lightning network? Or some other crypto L2?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not just that, but multi-tenancy is actually truly a “free lunch” from a resource utilization point of view, so any opportunity to pool resources represents a true win-win bargain. At the scale data centers worldwide, it's big — it depends on who you are, but you could either get excited about the gigatons of CO2 saved, or the increased corporate net income margin (I guess I like both!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A note about solid API's. Definitely something I care deeply about
and will need to think more about the API organization going forward
with wavy.</p>
