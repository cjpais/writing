    <h1>Apple’s M1 Impact on the Semiconductor Industry</h1>
<p>Apple’s release of ARM powered Mac’s is flipping the industry on it’s head. The sheer amount of press around this release is quite telling. The buzz on Twitter, HN, has been continuous.</p>
<p>At this point we all know they are <em>fast</em>. Not to mention the battery life achieved is out of this world.</p>
<p>These are fantastic things and these two factors will be the driving force for huge change in the industry. Consumer space and corporate space alike.</p>
<p>To refresh what we’ve learned since the release is this.</p>
<p>Power Usage:</p>
<p>CPU Speed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-Threaded</li>
<li>Multi-Threaded</li>
</ul>
<p>GPU:</p>

<p>3x density.</p>
<p>Opposition:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Begs the question, why do servers not currently use low power CPU’s?</p>
<ul>
<li>What do the workloads look like?</li>
<li>How can we compare an m1 webserver?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How can the m1 compete with desktop CPU’s then get crushed by laptop CPU’s?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Currently:</p>
<p>Looks like AMD still has a winner on its hands</p>
