    <h1>Impact of Apple’s M1 on the Semiconductor Industry</h1>
<p>Apple has shifted the balance of power with the release of the M1 powered Macs. Apple by releasing these M1 Macs is just begging for a response from the rest of the industry.</p>
<p>analyze the consumer space and the server space, and how</p>
<p>Will Apple’s transition to ARM force the hand on the rest of the industry to do the same? What will happen if this is the case? How do Intel and AMD respond. Where does this leave other semiconductor manufactures, notably Nvidia and Qualcomm?</p>
<p>Apple’s release of ARM powered Mac’s is flipping the industry on it’s head. The sheer amount of press around this release is quite telling. <a href="https://www.singhkays.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-black-magic/">The buzz on Twitter, HN, has been continuous</a>.</p>
<p>At this point we know they are <em><strong>fast</strong></em> with incredible battery life to boot.</p>
<p>These are fantastic things and these two factors will be the driving force for huge change in the industry. Consumer space and corporate space alike.</p>
<p>To refresh what we’ve learned since the release is this.</p>
<h2>Quantifying</h2>
<p>Unfortunately this chart does a pretty terrible job of telling really what is going on.</p>

<h3>Singlethreaded performance equaling desktop CPU’s.</h3>

<p>My guess is the M1 powered laptops really come into a class of their own when you are doing intense tasks on the battery. There have been some benchmarks that seem to validate this. The combination of power efficiency and speed means a lot more can be done on the laptio.</p>

<h2>Why has ARM been struggling in the server space and how apple is going to change this</h2>
<p>Well in the server space there seems to be little incentive to swap over to ARM especially given the huge hassle of changing ISA’s. Clearly this is not simple and that’s why Apple has spent so much time to provide tools to get people swapped over cleanly.</p>
<p>That is the beauty of what they’ve done. According to the stackoverflow developer survey, about 27.5% of developers use Apple systems. As we see a huge developer population move to ARM based Mac’s surely the tooling will have to support ARM very well.</p>
<p>This is massive and will force a rethink of the server space. Even Linus didn’t believe this was going to happen anytime soon</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people think that “the cloud” means that the instruction set doesn’t matter. Develop at home, deploy in the cloud.</p>
<p>That’s bullshit. If you develop on x86, then you’re going to want to deploy on x86, because you’ll be able to run what you test “at home” (and by “at home” I don’t mean literally in your home, but in your work environment).</p>
<p>Which means that you’ll happily pay a bit more for x86 cloud hosting, simply because it matches what you can test on your own local setup, and the errors you get will translate better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which in turn means that cloud providers will end up making more money from their x86 side, which means that they’ll prioritize it, and any ARM offerings will be secondary and probably relegated to the mindless dregs (maybe front-end, maybe just static html, that kind of stuff).</p>
<p>Guys, do you really not understand why x86 took over the server market?</p>
<p>It wasn’t just all price. It was literally this “develop at home” issue. Thousands of small companies ended up having random small internal workloads where it was easy to just get a random whitebox PC and run some silly small thing on it yourself. Then as the workload expanded, it became a “real server”. And then once that thing expanded, suddenly it made a whole lot of sense to let somebody else manage the hardware and hosting, and the cloud took over.</p>
<p>https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=183440&amp;curpostid=183486</p>
<p>ARM is already crushing x86 in the server space, but is probably highly underutilized. https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd/9</p>
<p>I would guess that Amazon is making boatloads on these CPU’s when compared to their Intel and AMD counterparts, due to the lower power consumption.</p>
<h2>My Interpretation in Context of the Questions</h2>
<p>Opposition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Begs the question, why do servers not currently use low power CPU’s?
<ul>
<li>What do the workloads look like?</li>
<li>How can we compare an m1 webserver?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How can the m1 compete with desktop CPU’s then get crushed by laptop CPU’s?</li>
<li>ARM compatibility on Linux? How good is it and will Apple’s transition actually help here?</li>
</ul>
<p>Why the industry might want to move to ARM anyway. Or why there might be a push.</p>
<h2>LOTS OF COMPETITION IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY</h2>
<p>Hard to say who will do well and who wont, but here’s my predictions</p>
<h2>AMD</h2>
<p>Looks like AMD still has a winner on its hands with the Zen3 arch. Very efficient and very fast. Doesn’t look like they are going to go away any time soon unless they falter on their next microarchs.</p>
<p>They have put some ARM based CPU’s into the market according to: https://www.anandtech.com/show/15575/amperes-altra-80-core-n1-soc-for-hyperscalers-against-rome-and-xeon</p>
<h2>Intel</h2>
<p>Intel. Intel has some work to do.</p>
<h2>Qualcomm</h2>
<p>From QC perspective there is a huge opportunity with Apple moving to ARM. People see the performance and battery life they can get from a MBA. Beyond this Qualcomm has the value add of being able to add a modem for always connected PC’s. It is very dependent if people even want this in the first place. The cost of 4G/5G service is much more $/GB, however you don’t ever have to worry about wifi. I use my phone without worries much of these days and would be very nice to do the same for my computer.</p>
<h2>Nvidia</h2>
<p>Nvidia I think has the most interesting spot out of all the major semiconductor manufacturers. They are already breaking into the server space with their GPU’s. They also recently purchased ARM Holdings and have been making ARM based CPU’s for some time with their Tegra line (however they have not seen much consumer success). This potentially leaves Nvidia in a very nice position to bene</p>
<p>NVLink with the CPU????</p>
<h2>Amazon</h2>
<p>We have started to see the shift already and Amazon is on top of it. They have</p>
<p>It will take a while for the rest of the industry to catch up, but as more and more developers start building docker images for ARM, I suspect more and more ARM servers will be desired.</p>
<h2>New Players</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere_Computing">Ampere</a>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia is partnering with them as well. GPU-accelerated ARM servers partnership too……</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Nuvia</li>

<h2>INTERCONNECTS?????!!!</h2>
<h2>What about RISC-V??</h2>
<h2>CPU’s used by AWS</h2>

<li>C4 - E5-2666 (v3 and v4)</li>
<li>C5n - Intel Platinum (3ghz)</li>
<li>C5a - AMD EPYC 7002</li>

<li>Custom based on Cascade Lake</li>
