# Apple's M1 Impact on the Semiconductor Industry

Will Apple's transition to ARM force the hand on the rest of the industry to do the same?
What will happen if this is the case? How do Intel and AMD respond. Where does this leave
NVidia?

Apple's release of ARM powered Mac's is flipping the industry on it's head. The 
sheer amount of press around this release is quite telling. The buzz on Twitter,
HN, has been continuous.

At this point we all know they are *fast*. Not to mention the battery life achieved is out of this world. 

These are fantastic things and these two factors will be the driving force for huge 
change in the industry. Consumer space and corporate space alike.

To refresh what we've learned since the release is this.


Power Usage:

CPU Speed:
* Single-Threaded
* Multi-Threaded

GPU:
* GPU in MBA competes 
  * https://www.notebookcheck.net/Apple-MacBook-Air-2020-M1-Benchmarks-Should-you-get-7-or-8-GPU-cores.506105.0.html
  * 

* Power comparison
* Performance comparison

3x density.


Opposition:

* Begs the question, why do servers not currently use low power CPU's?
  * What do the workloads look like?
  * How can we compare an m1 webserver?
* How can the m1 compete with desktop CPU's then get crushed by laptop CPU's?
* ARM compatibility on Linux? How good is it and will Apple's transition actually help here?

Why the industry might want to move to ARM anyway. Or why there might be a push.


Currently:

Looks like AMD still has a winner on its hands with the Zen3 arch. Very efficient 
and very fast. Doesn't look like they are going to go away any time soon unless
they falter on their next microarchs.

Intel. Intel has some work to do.

## Qualcomm:

From QC perspective there is a huge opportunity with Apple moving to ARM.
People see the performance and battery life they can get from a MBA. 
Beyond this Qualcomm has the value add of being able to add a modem
for always connected PC's. It is very dependent if people even want this
in the first place. The cost of 4G/5G service is much more $/GB, however
you don't ever have to worry about wifi. I use my phone without worries
much of these days and would be very nice to do the same for my computer.
