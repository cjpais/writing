    <h1>Monday November 23rd, 2020</h1>
<p>Went for a nice bike ride this morning. Ate and now time to start to work and think and write. Will do a bit of private journaling this morning.</p>
<p>I spent too much time in the shower. Just comfortable and thinking. Probably should change this to be mediation instead of just standing there wasting resources.</p>
<p>Have my PT appointment at 10:30. Getting dinner with Jon tonight.</p>
