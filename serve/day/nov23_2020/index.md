# Monday November 23rd, 2020

Went for a nice bike ride this morning. Ate and now time to start to work and think and write.
Will do a bit of private journaling this morning.

I spent too much time in the shower. Just comfortable and thinking. Probably should change
this to be mediation instead of just standing there wasting resources.

Have my PT appointment at 10:30. Getting dinner with Jon tonight.
