# Monday November 23rd, 2020

Went for a nice bike ride this morning. Ate and now time to start to work and think and write.
Will do a bit of private journaling this morning.

I spent too much time in the shower. Just comfortable and thinking. Probably should change
this to be mediation instead of just standing there wasting resources.

Have my PT appointment at 10:30. Getting dinner with Jon tonight.

## RockOn - AR Climbing App

So I have been thinking while driving. Basically want to see what is the route in front of me
or how to get to it. Originally I was going to use drone mapping to build a 3D model. This might
be cool in the future but is probably overkill for now. I think the best thing to do is make it a 
dead simple AR application.

I am thinking. I am at the crag, I open the app and I point it at the rock and it should tell me
what the route in front of me is. Ideally it should also place a line for the route direction.

## PT Appointment

Got cleared for everything as expected. Obviously the right knee is not perfect yet but it's damn good.

## ARKit

So spent most of the day playing around with AR Kit. I am able to add entities to the AR Scene which is nice.
There's still so much more to do though. We need to check to see if this is even possible when at a crag.
Will I have to rely on other techniques as provided by AR Kit? I am not sure. Again the problem is iOS vs.
Android here too. But the thing is the documentation for iOS is good.
