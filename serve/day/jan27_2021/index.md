Weew what a morning. Got a bunch of misc tasks out of the way, and now have some time to think.
Did finish *Entangled Life* which was great. Didn't realize how close I was to the end of the book, but sweet. 

I really only put out a couple of tasks out for today.

* Summarize yesterdays writing
* Create ML projects matching some aspects of what I want to learn (this could be doing it backwards, but fine) 

If these go quickly, the podcast *The Self Employment Meta-Game* has been interesting so far.
It also had a question which is worth examining. 

* "What is a story of your life that you're compelled by"

Another thing that we should get done before this one is to write about where we are with the computer project.

## Summarizing

Comes down to a few things. 

* Think big
  * World Peace
* Need to learn ML (interest in AGI)
* Reduce Scope
* I would like to be in a position of influence, while maintaining a healthy lifestyle balance. Tell me it can't be done. 

## ML Learning

Looking to tackle learning in a few ways.

* Want to understand language models.
* Want to understand labelers (video, audio, text)
* Want to understand transformer networks and their purpose
* Want to know pivotal moments/major advancements in AI tech

I think it makes sense to start with labelers.
So the projects for this seem to be relatively straightforward and obvious

* Speech Recognition -> Text
  * Then labeling or generating overall context of this in tags
    * This implies generating tags from text, this could be a challenge.
  * Overall goal to transcribe podcast text with relatively high level of accuracy
    * Ideally with timestamps. Word and time level recognition. => good input data
* AR Video -> Boxes and labels (computer vision problem)

Once we have the labelers down (data generation), I think it will then 
be important to understand how we can actually access the data.

So this will probably need to be some kind of transformer based language 
model similar to GPT-3. 

Before diving into any of this I think we should find some course sylibi and
see what they want me to read.
