Weew what a morning. Got a bunch of misc tasks out of the way, and now have some time to think.
Did finish *Entangled Life* which was great. Didn't realize how close I was to the end of the book, but sweet. 

I really only put out a couple of tasks out for today.

* Summarize yesterdays writing
* Create ML projects matching some aspects of what I want to learn (this could be doing it backwards, but fine) 

If these go quickly, the podcast *The Self Employment Meta-Game* has been interesting so far.
It also had a question which is worth examining. 

"What is a story of your life that you're compelled by"

## Summarizing
