Weew what a morning. Got a bunch of misc tasks out of the way, and now have some time to think.
Did finish *Entangled Life* which was great. Didn't realize how close I was to the end of the book, but sweet. 

I really only put out a couple of tasks out for today.

* Summarize yesterdays writing
* Create ML projects matching some aspects of what I want to learn (this could be doing it backwards, but fine) 

If these go quickly, the podcast *The Self Employment Meta-Game* has been interesting so far.
It also had a question which is worth examining. 

* "What is a story of your life that you're compelled by"

Another thing that we should get done before this one is to write about where we are with the computer project.

## Summarizing

Comes down to a few things. 

* Think big
  * World Peace
* Need to learn ML (interest in AGI)
* Reduce Scope
* I would like to be in a position of influence, while maintaining a healthy lifestyle balance. Tell me it can't be done. This should be augmented by the above question about story of my life I'm compelled by.

## ML Learning

Looking to tackle learning in a few ways.

* Want to understand language models.
* Want to understand labelers (video, audio, text)
* Want to understand transformer networks and their purpose
* Want to know pivotal moments/major advancements in AI tech

As a beginner it might be good to start basic too, with stuff like

* Handwriting Recognition

I think it makes sense to start with labelers.
So the projects for this seem to be relatively straightforward and obvious

* Speech Recognition -> Text
  * Overall goal to transcribe podcast text with relatively high level of accuracy
    * Ideally with timestamps. Word and time level recognition. => good input data
* AR Video -> Boxes and labels (computer vision problem)
* Generating overall context of podcast/audio in tags
  * This implies generating tags from text, this could be a challenge.

Once we have the labelers down (data generation), I think it will then 
be important to understand how we can actually access the data.

So this will probably need to be some kind of transformer based language 
model similar to GPT-3. 

Before diving into any of this I think we should find some course sylibi and
see what they want me to read. Let's take a look at UCSD's grad courses.

## [[ML Learning Notes]]

Coming from coursera

Basically given some input (experience, sense data) provide some output, and 
measure performance of output

### Supervised Learning

Classification could be like assigning boolean value to something

Regression is more like trying to assign numerical value

### Unsupervised Learning

Ideally this is what I want. 

Clustering Algorithms, basically taking data and clustering them based on likeness
in some way. TODO

How can we cluster computer data?

Interesting note of two recordings and separating out languages. This could be 
similar to speaker recognition

## Compelling Story of My Life

Well damn, so far we are doing pretty damn good. We quit our job. And we are going
out to do whatever we want. I definitely don't want that to end anytime soon.
Really I would love to continue it indefinitely. However at some point it will
need to make some level of money in some capacity. What that capacity is? Not sure.
I do want to own a home. But I want to be in a place where the home doesn't hold me
down, but is more just a base where I operate from. Want to have a beautiful wife and
a couple of kids at some point relatively soon too. In 5 years probably. Right around
30 or a little past. If I have to go back to work, I want to maintain a high level 
of independence while still being able to pay the bills. If this means freelancing
maybe that's what I need to do. I just want to continue to get good at climbing.
But ultimately I want to be in a place where I have my hands in a ton of different
aspects able to help influence direction on a global scale. Only able to do this
with the help of a lot of other people. ego speaking? maybe.

## Misc

During the bike ride there was a few interesting things to come of the podcasts.
Well one more obvious thing is that for the podcasts we can just transcribe 
an absolute fuck ton. Want to make this convienient for something like are.na.
Basically how do you make audio more transparent? See the big themes at once
and then all the text there with audio. Yes otter.ai
