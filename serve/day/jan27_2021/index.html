    <h1>Wednesday, January 27, 2021</h1>
<p>Weew what a morning. Got a bunch of misc tasks out of the way, and now have some time to think.
Did finish <em>Entangled Life</em> which was great. Didn't realize how close I was to the end of the book, but sweet.</p>
<p>I really only put out a couple of tasks out for today.</p>
<ul>
<li>Summarize yesterdays writing</li>
<li>Create ML projects matching some aspects of what I want to learn (this could be doing it backwards, but fine)</li>
</ul>
<p>If these go quickly, the podcast <em>The Self Employment Meta-Game</em> has been interesting so far.
It also had a question which is worth examining.</p>
<p>&quot;What is a story of your life that you're compelled by&quot;</p>
<h2>Summarizing</h2>
