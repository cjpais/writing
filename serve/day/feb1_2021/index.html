    <h1>Monday, February 1, 2021</h1>
<p>Lots of notes today, but will just write down the one that came to mind.</p>
<p>I still have lots of reading to do today. I'm about 50/100 pages right now and
getting slightly tired.</p>
<p>Linus mentioned one joy of making small tools is purely for the self. To
satisfy and have a workflow for the self. Maybe that is what I need to aim
for. I have always been thinking about how to satisfy other people's needs,
however I really just need to satisfy my own. So far I have a system that I like
but it definitely could be improved with some features that Linus has as well.
I would like to have some more schema and document it slightly more in terms
of architecture.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will make it relatively easy to replicate at some scale. Removing
some fragility in the system will be important too, but for now that is not
so important.</p>
<p>Anyway just something to keep in mind for the future.</p>
<p>Definitely need to give <em>Rethink Humanity</em> another read</p>
