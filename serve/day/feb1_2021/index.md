Lots of notes today, but will just write down the one that came to mind.

I still have lots of reading to do today. I'm about 50/100 pages right now and
getting slightly tired.

Linus mentioned one joy of making small tools is purely for the self. To 
satisfy and have a workflow for the self. Maybe that is what I need to aim
for. I have always been thinking about how to satisfy other people's needs,
however I really just need to satisfy my own. So far I have a system that I like
but it definitely could be improved with some features that Linus has as well.
I would like to have some more schema and document it slightly more in terms 
of architecture.

Hopefully this will make it relatively easy to replicate at some scale. Removing
some fragility in the system will be important too, but for now that is not 
so important.

Anyway just something to keep in mind for the future. 

Definitely need to give *Rethink Humanity* another read
