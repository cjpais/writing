    <h1>Thursday, February 11, 2021</h1>
<p>So need to make a few decisions this morning with relation to serving API.</p>
<p>Lol okay I don't want to but the whole thing is going to be in python.
The other way to go about it would be to write things out to file,
then serve from golang but this seems overly complex even though python
is going to be a pain as well.</p>
