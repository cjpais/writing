    <h1>Monday October 26th, 2020</h1>
<p>I’ve been quiet for a few days now. There has been a lot going on in my life and haven’t really sat down and taken the time to write publicly. I have been doing an <em>TON</em> of writing in my journal however.</p>
<p>A few notable things are happening that I’m willing to share.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am going to buy a van and live in it</li>
<li>I am shifting focus from note-taking/tools-for-thought to building climbing focused apps/tools</li>
<li>I am climbing El Cap in 2021</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of all this going on I may be sharing and interacting less on a daily basis as I focus on research and making decisions. This is where the majority of my time is</p>
