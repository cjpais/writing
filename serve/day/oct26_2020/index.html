    <h1>Monday October 26th, 2020</h1>
<p>I’ve been quiet for a few days now. There has been a lot going on in my life and haven’t really sat down and taken the time to write publicly. I have been doing an <em>TON</em> of writing in my journal however.</p>
<p>A few notable things are happening that I’m willing to share.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am going to buy a van and live in it</li>
<li>I am shifting focus from note-taking/tools-for-thought to building climbing focused apps/tools
<ul>
<li>I think the tools in the space are lacking in a lot of ways and there’s huge room for improvement and community building. This is something I am very excited about and has real tangible benefits to other people. I was stuck for 2 years trying to find a group of people to climb with outside. How to make this process easier and more discoverable. I think there’s a few ways to go about this and I’m very excited to get going. My goal in 6 months (June 31st) is to make a sale either to gyms or people. Goal for 12 months (end of 2021) is to be fully self-sustainable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I am climbing El Cap in 2021</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of all this going on I may be sharing and interacting less on a daily basis in the ‘tech’ community as I focus on research and making decisions to further these goals. This is where the majority of my time is going.</p>
