# [[Projects]]

A collection of the things that are started/in-progress or abandoned.

This should serve as a directory to the projects.

Each of which should have - last updated, and linked to why.

## [[Podcast]]

Feature List TODO:

* Share
* Chapters (lex)
* API (import from server)
* Transcription (below)
* Downloading player

Features finished:
* Re-Listen
* Record Audio notes

## [[Podcast Transcription]]

## [[Forum]]

For ideas in a wide variety of sectors. Encourage discussion of the ideas 
with the goal of them eventually to be funded.

## [[World Peace]]

## [[Bitcoin]]

## [[Markdown Linter]]

And markdown extension. Would love to be able to have a sidebar.
Want width of lines capped at 100 chars or less (ideally 80). 

Basically starting to turn markdown into almost WYSIWYG by default.
And have direct linking and commenting in the sidebar(s), but all in
plaintext. 

## [[Financials]]

* Learn about the petro-dollar
* See if I can capture transactions.
  * even if a monthly thing. retrospective on spending.
* Stock portfolio vs market
* Asset classes
* Understanding US Debt
* Understanding China in relation to the US economy
* Post oil economy
* Understanding 2008 crisis

## [[Meshtastic]]

## [[Distributed Internet]] (LTE/5G)

CBRS.

Need to ensure security of traffic, make sure people operating base stations
cannot snoop on traffic going through the network. Fink brought this up.

Computer/Cell Tower should be able to run on solar. 

One feature of this system at the most basic form could be giving everyone
unlimited internet and data. Have people run base stations which are super
speced out, and distributed across a large area to provide these kind of
network benefits. Paying into the carrier is really paying into a larger 
infrastructure that benefits everyone. Allows us to innovate a lot faster
and take traffic away from companies like amazon, by running the edge

## [[My Design Language]]

* maybe taking inspo from interior design
* also from fashion, the colors i enjoy
  * this goodwill burgundy shirt, nice.

## [[Edge Compute]]


## [[Notes/Tag Search Interface and Creation]]

## [[Maker Space]]

Wonder if it's possible to get something like this actually off the ground 
in a post-covid world and who else would be interested.

Would be interested to talk more to Austin (surfboard shaper) more about
this potentially. How possible would it be to have this place open
to the public? 

Maybe can teach skills and stuff?

* Shaping surfboards
* Sewing machines
* Building bikes
* Tech stuff (server room!)
  * lots of raspberry pi

How possible to have a MakerSpace and a Hacker House all in one? How many people
can come together? A collective of creators with a large space to experiment with.

On premise infra developed by the people there. Creation of a process together.

## [[Young Futures]]

1/26/21: After a lot of conversation the bigger problem that I am seeing is not
necessarily a lack of access to computers. But really the problem is lack
of computer science education in K-12 schools across the nation. Would 
love to quantify this. 

The next question after quantification is how to get information out there and
affect change in some way.

### TODO

* Quantify how many schools K-12 have computer science/computer literacy
  * Available
    * Mandatory
    * Advanced Learning
  * Unavailable
  * Extra-Curricular Programs
    * FIRST
* How do we keep kids engaged in computer science learning?
* What are next generation teaching techniques, that blend the physical and digital
  * Really the more important question. What are the needs of students which are not being met as part of current education curriculum?
  * What parts of curriculum don't allow them to explore?
  * What is the base knowledge needed for success in the next century?
* Will there be more school from home? Similar to remote work? Remote schooling?

## [[Calendar]]/[[Personal Relationship Manager]]

Want a text calendar, but this should be deeply intertwined with a
personal relationship manager. Basically being able to record
information about people I interact with, what I am doing with
them. What we talked about. Future questions. Other personal
information about them.

specifically be able to enter events simply

"surfing with chandler 6:30 am pipes tuesday"

after this would want to be able to add any notes, to the event, or person directly.

## [[Natural Language Processing]]/[[Reflect]]

Would love to have Otter but an API behind it. Something where I can 
get information out.

Maybe need to launch a projects site. Where I can add the projects I am
thinking about as well as what they are (if they are finished)

Or what I am thinking about in terms of that project. 

### TODO

* Learn Fundamentals of Machine Learning
  * Computer Vision
  * Natural Language Processing (Text and Audio)
    * Speaker identification and labeling
      * Especially given input and former samples
  * Be able to label (aka tag) things coming from nearly any data source
    * Put this in some kind of super generic graph, maybe starts with some manually defined labels. Generated from podcast app, is a podcast etc
