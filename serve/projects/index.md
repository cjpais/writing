1/26/21: After a lot of conversation the bigger problem that I am seeing is not
necessarily a lack of access to computers. But really the problem is lack
of computer science education in K-12 schools across the nation. Would 
love to quantify this. 

The next question after quantification is how to get information out there and
affect change in some way.

### TODO

* Quantify how many schools K-12 have computer science/computer literacy
  * Available
    * Mandatory
    * Advanced Learning
  * Unavailable
  * Extra-Ciricular Programs
    * FIRST

## [[Natural Language Processing]]/[[Reflect]]

### TODO

* Learn Fundamentals of Machine Learning
  * Computer Vision
  * Natural Language Processing (Text and Audio)
    * Speaker identification and labeling
      * Especially given input and former samples
  * Be able to label (aka tag) things coming from nearly any data source
    * Put this in some kind of super generic graph, maybe starts with some manually defined labels. Generated from podcast app, is a podcast etc
