<p>1/26/21: After a lot of conversation the bigger problem that I am seeing is not
necessarily a lack of access to computers. But really the problem is lack
of computer science education in K-12 schools across the nation. Would
love to quantify this.</p>
<p>The next question after quantification is how to get information out there and
affect change in some way.</p>
<h3>TODO</h3>
<ul>
<li>Quantify how many schools K-12 have computer science/computer literacy
<ul>
<li>Available
<ul>
<li>Mandatory</li>
<li>Advanced Learning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unavailable</li>
<li>Extra-Ciricular Programs
<ul>
<li>FIRST</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do we keep kids engaged in computer science learning?</li>
<li>What are next generation teaching techniques, that blend the physical and digital
<ul>
<li>Really the more important question. What are the needs of students which are not being met as part of current education ciriculum?</li>
<li>What parts of ciriculum don't allow them to explore?</li>
<li>What is the base knowledge needed for success in the next century?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Will there be more school from home? Similar to remote work? Remote schooling?</li>
</ul>
<h2>[[Natural Language Processing]]/[[Reflect]]</h2>
<h3>TODO</h3>
<ul>
<li>Learn Fundamentals of Machine Learning
<ul>
<li>Computer Vision</li>
<li>Natural Language Processing (Text and Audio)
<ul>
<li>Speaker identification and labeling
<ul>
<li>Especially given input and former samples</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be able to label (aka tag) things coming from nearly any data source
<ul>
<li>Put this in some kind of super generic graph, maybe starts with some manually defined labels. Generated from podcast app, is a podcast etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
