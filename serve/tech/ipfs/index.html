    <h1>Serve Subdomain (Google Domains) on IPFS</h1>
<p>This is a quick and dirty guide to help you serve a website on IPFS.
Specifically from a domain where the DNS is controlled by Google.
My domain (<a href="cjpais.com">cjpais.com</a>) is a Google Domain and I struggled
with some of the steps.</p>
<p>The first thing you will want to do is gather the files you want to host.
This could come from a SSG like Hugo, a React App that you've written,
or perhaps like me, just a pure HTML/JS/CSS page. In any case you
will have some <code>index.html</code> which will be the root of what you serve.</p>

This is what my directory looks like.</p>
