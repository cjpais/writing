    <h1>T1N Sprinter</h1>
<p>A collection of resources related to the T1N (2003-2006) Sprinter. Badged as Mercedes, Dodge or Freightliner.</p>
<h2>Buying</h2>
<p>When buying want to avoid rust for sure. I would be wary of buying from somewhere where there is a lot of rain and snow. This is an older vehicle so there is greater chance of rust.</p>
<h3>Where to Buy</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>San Diego</p></li>
<li><p>Los Angeles</p></li>
<li><p>Arizona</p></li>
<li><p>Vegas</p>
<ul>
<li>Not seeing a lot of sprinters here….</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Sacramento</p></li>
<li><p>New Mexico?</p></li>

</ul>
<h3>Before Buying</h3>
<p>Read these:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://sprinter-source.com/forums/index.php?threads/79741/
<ul>
<li>Check the brake rotors for wear with the wheels on</li>
<li>Assess the exhaust?</li>
<li>Evaluate tire wear and the age of tires</li>
<li>Pull the oil dip stick and look and smell, is it good?</li>
<li>Check the transmission oil level with the dipstick you brought with you because old sprinters don’t have one.</li>
<li>Sit down and read the service records, no service records, don’t buy.</li>
<li>When were the injectors last checked?</li>
<li>Now go for a drive, does it drive straight, does the cruise control work?</li>
<li>Do the brakes work?</li>
<li>Most important, does the temperature hold at 185-190 F.</li>
<li>Now, does the emergency brake work?
<ul>
<li>That tells alot about the rear brakes condition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>OK, hook up your scanner after the drive and check for codes.</li>
<li>Check the lights.</li>
<li>Now look at the battery and especially the terminals. look new and clean?</li>
<li>Check the ground strap connections.</li>
<li>Crawl under the vehicle again, is it bleeding?</li>
<li>Check that the CEL, ABS and Glow Plug lights come on and then go out with the ignition turned on but not starting the engine</li>
<li>Bring a scanner. Autel AP200</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
