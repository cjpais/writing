## Buying

When buying want to avoid rust for sure. I would be wary of buying from somewhere where there is a lot of
rain and snow. This is an older vehicle so there is greater chance of rust.

### Where to Buy

* San Diego
* Los Angeles
* Arizona
* Vegas
  * Not seeing a lot of sprinters here....
* Sacramento
* New Mexico?

### Before Buying

Read these:

  * Check the brake rotors for wear with the wheels on 
  * Assess the exhaust? 
  * Evaluate tire wear and the age of tires
  * Pull the oil dip stick and look and smell, is it good?
  * Check the transmission oil level with the dipstick you brought with you because old sprinters don't have one.
  * Sit down and read the service records, no service records, don't buy.
  * When were the injectors last checked?
  * Now go for a drive, does it drive straight, does the cruise control work?
  * Do the brakes work?
  * Most important, does the temperature hold at 185-190 F.
  * Now, does the emergency brake work?
    * That tells alot about the rear brakes condition.
  * OK, hook up your scanner after the drive and check for codes.
  * Check the lights. 
  * Now look at the battery and especially the terminals. look new and clean?
  * Check the ground strap connections.
  * Crawl under the vehicle again, is it bleeding?
  * Check that the CEL, ABS and Glow Plug lights come on and then go out with the ignition turned on but not starting the engine
  * Bring a scanner. Autel AP200
