# Van Requirements

This will be a collection of all the things I possibly want in the van.
Not all of them will be possible. This will be due to either budget
or space reqs. 

## Living Space

### Bed

* Fixed bed, width wise. Would like >= 6ft of room total. 
  * Will need to do some research. T1N Sprinter might be tight
* Enough height to sit straight up with my back against the wall

### Shower/Toilet

* Ideally would want a shower. Potentially a toilet, but I think this is more optional.
* Water heater

### Clothes

* At minimum would want a couple of cabinets that can be used for clothes in travel squares
* This probably should go overhead the bed. 

### Kitchen

* Sink with running water
  * Foot pump/Electric Pump?
* Stove
  * Induction/Propane?
  * Portable/Fixed?
* Fridge
  * Door/Lid?
* Trash Bin
* Recycle Bin
* Spice Rack (12-16 total, gotta eat well)

#### Pots/Pans/Etc

All the things that need to fit (ideally)

* Cast Iron
* 3.3Qt Sauce Pan
* Medium Pot (and small one)
* Couple of plates (4?)
* Couple of glasses
* Couple of mugs
* Cutting board
* Pressure Cooker
  
#### Utensils

* Utensils (4 of each)
* Kitchen Knife
* Pairing Knife
* Knife Sharpener
* Kitchen Scissors
* Can opener

### Misc

* Bookshelf
* Hangboard
* Yoga Mat
* Outdoor Rug?

## Workspace

* Fit 27" monitor
  * Should be able to be used as the primary and the laptop as the secondary easily.
  * This might be mounted in a way directly above my laptop, so the laptop can be used as a keyboard and mouse
  * This could also give me space to use the iPad as a monitor as well.
* Ideally fit keyboard too (if the monitor is used as the primary and laptop off to the side)
* Comfortable seat. Can be relatively simple, but give me some place to stretch and do strange things with my legs
* Ideally some kind of whiteboard to sketch or whatever
* Pullout table? Kitchen table? Dropdown monitor?

## Water

* Not sure if I want to do one large tank or multiple smaller tanks.
* This depends on the shower I think
* 

## Garage

* Rock climbing gear (ropes, trad rack, etc)
* Space for two bikes, fork mounted
* Ideally surfboard space (8' x 22.5" x 3.25")
* Freediving gear
* Sewing machine
