# Van Timeline

## Dec 1st, 2020 - Buy Van

Buy the van and begin work. Be living in a cheaper place. That means Nov should be my last month in Mira Mesa. Latest I will stay is at the end of the year. I need to give 30 day notice to my
landlord (what a strange word) soon. Latest will be Nov 30th. 

## March 1st, 2020 - Van Complete
Goal is to have the van built and being lived in by March 1st 2020.
