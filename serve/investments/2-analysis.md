This really all kicked off with a Friday evening (2/5/2021 ~7:00pm) 
conversation with Alex as I was driving to Joshua Tree for a climbing trip.
We had a whole lot more to discuss than financials and investments,
however it became one of the more interesting topics we stumbled upon.

Well this is to say, I've been talking some big game about my investments
this year. It was hard not to do good in these COVID times. A perfect storm
to buy in if you could afford it. 

What I did say were two-fold:

* I can live off of my investments for life
* I have had ~100% returns this year, with a good amount of my portfolio > 200%

Specifically I mentioned one thing
that might be true. I think that I could live off of my investments for the 
rest of my life.
