This really all kicked off with a Friday evening (2/5/2021 ~7:00pm) 
conversation with Alex as I was driving to Joshua Tree for a climbing trip.
We had a whole lot more to discuss than financials and investments,
however it became one of the more interesting topics we stumbled upon.

Well this is to say, I've been talking some big game about my investments
this year. It was hard not to do good in these COVID times. A perfect storm
to buy in if you could afford it. 

What I did say were two-fold:

* I can live off of my investments for life
* I have had ~100% returns this year

It seems these two things make some ears perk. Sure a good amount is in $TSLA
which obviously inflates how well my portfolio has done. However on the whole
I think my strategy is a winning one. 

With this said I'd like to review a few aspects of my current portfolio.

* How well I've done with respect to common market indices
  * Over all time
  * Over the past year
  * Month over month
* Would my investments grow if I take $2000/mo out of them
  * Starting Jan 2020 (only had enough money in to make it viable)
  * Take an even amount out of all stocks (unrealistic however)
