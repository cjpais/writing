# Future

The future of how I want to invest depends on *you*. 

I believe that 

> "Evil doesn't have to be an overt act; it can be merely the absence of good. If you have the ability, the resources, and the opportunity to do good and you do nothing, that can be evil

I am continuously refining the ways I want to invest.

But the fundamental is always the same. I want to invest in a better future.
A future looking towards world peace, with less conflict, and sustainable growth

A future that gives more people access to more things, and redistributes wealth
to those who do not have access to capital. To provide everyone education
