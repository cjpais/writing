# Future

The future of how I want to invest depends on *you*. 

I believe that *we* as collective set of individuals have the power to do 
transformative good in the world without the need for centralized power telling
us what to do. I think we have seen the collapse of institutions doing good. 

Very few people I meet are happy with their jobs. You don't like selling life
insurance to people who don't need it? No kidding. Maybe we should focus on
preventative healthcare. Researching individualized diets based on 
microbiome research.

This is to say, I think with enough people, we can throw our weight behind
truly good things in the world. By doing this we should outweigh the 
'bad'/'evil' things. 

I think the first steps are to collect some money and put it towards good
and future looking investments. I think every person who is putting money in
should have a voice on the companies 

Ultimately I would like to have a crowdfunded and voted VC fund. To have 
enough money to take risks. To have a platform where ideas can be played with
and eventually funded in a collaborative way. The funding should not be massive
investments as we see with traditional funding, but rather an effort between
open source work and funding those contributors in a meaningful way. Paying
them more than livable wages while reducing overhead. Trying to keep lean,
not aim for scale but again sustainable growth. Patagonia style.

If there is good that we can do that doesn't make money, we should do this
too. We should make money through our investments, not just to make more
money, but to do good. We should expect returns for everyone, but we should
also be investing into everyone's future. 

To have experts in every category to bounce ideas off of and see if that idea
is truly good. Ideas are valuable based not on the amount of money they 
generate but by the good they do in the world. That good likely will be 
rewarded with money. 

Cost savings across industry is important, but that is a neutral thing. We
want net good. Not just something financially viable.

> "Evil doesn't have to be an overt act; it can be merely the absence of good. If you have the ability, the resources, and the opportunity to do good and you do nothing, that can be evil

I am continuously refining the ways I want to invest.

But the fundamental is always the same. I want to invest in a better future.
A future looking towards world peace, with less conflict, and sustainable growth

A future that gives more people access to more things, and redistributes wealth
to those who do not have access to capital. To provide everyone education
