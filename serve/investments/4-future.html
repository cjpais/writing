    <h1>Future</h1>
<p>The future of how I want to invest depends on <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>I believe that <em>we</em> as collective set of individuals have the power to do
transformative good in the world without the need for centralized power telling
us what to do. I think we have seen the collapse of institutions doing good.</p>
<p>Very few people I meet are happy with their jobs. You don't like selling life
insurance to people who don't need it? No kidding. Maybe we should focus on
preventative healthcare. Researching individualized diets based on
microbiome research.</p>
<p>This is to say, I think with enough people, we can throw our weight behind
truly good things in the world. By doing this we should outweigh the
'bad'/'evil' things.</p>
<p>I think the first steps are to collect some money and put it towards good
and future looking investments. I think every person who is putting money in
should have a voice on the companies</p>
<p>Ultimately I would like to have a crowdfunded and voted VC fund. To have
enough money to take risks. To have a platform where ideas can be played with
and eventually funded in a collaborative way. The funding should not be massive
investments as we see with traditional funding, but rather an effort between
open source work and funding those contributors in a meaningful way. Paying
them more than livable wages while reducing overhead. Trying to keep lean,
not aim for scale but again sustainable growth. Patagonia style.</p>
<p>If there is good that we can do that doesn't make money, we should do this
too. We should make money through our investments, not just to make more
money, but to do good. We should expect returns for everyone, but we should
also be investing into everyone's future.</p>
<p>To have experts in every category to bounce ideas off of and see if that idea
is truly good. Ideas are valuable based not on the amount of money they
generate but by the good they do in the world. That good likely will be
rewarded with money.</p>
<p>Cost savings across industry is important, but that is a neutral thing. We
want net good. Not just something financially viable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Evil doesn't have to be an overt act; it can be merely the absence of good. If you have the ability, the resources, and the opportunity to do good and you do nothing, that can be evil</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am continuously refining the ways I want to invest.</p>
<p>But the fundamental is always the same. I want to invest in a better future.
A future looking towards world peace, with less conflict, and sustainable growth</p>
<p>A future that gives more people access to more things, and redistributes wealth
to those who do not have access to capital. To provide everyone education</p>
<p>One long term future idea would be along with this model, is we can iterate
through ideas much faster than any other accelerator. We essentially will build
facilities needed to support ideation. Where we just need to pay people, and pool
resources to invest wisely in hardware that can be used by a variety of people.
This means that no single person owns a machine, and we can distribute across the
network of people to see what we need more or less of. What capacity and scheduling
we cannot fill. Basically a bunch of labs/freezers, etc. Everyone has access, but
it is more of a flow. No single person has just their own lab it may be shared with
multiple people. The resources are shared with everyone who is being funded. This can
put capacity at the number of ideas going through. So the ideas themselves may need
to be prioritized which could be a dangerous game to play.</p>
<p>I think of this in terms of specifically compute for machine learning. We need to be
investing in techniques to reduce machine learning time and share this openly with
the world in order to minimize energy cost. This means also investing in startups
who are working in the TPU space. Specifically look out for Jim Keller and the
startup he is currently working for and is CTO?! Beyond this we want to build our own
farm of GPU/TPU so people can run their stuff on a giant cluster and get the GPU hours
they need without having to fork out for the infrastructure and pay it to Amazon or
physically own it. We will maintain it all and put it all to use and when things get
old we will repurpose the hardware for better things.</p>
