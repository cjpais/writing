    <h1>Future</h1>
<p>The future of how I want to invest depends on <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>I believe that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Evil doesn't have to be an overt act; it can be merely the absence of good. If you have the ability, the resources, and the opportunity to do good and you do nothing, that can be evil</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am continuously refining the ways I want to invest.</p>
<p>But the fundamental is always the same. I want to invest in a better future.
A future looking towards world peace, with less conflict, and sustainable growth</p>
<p>A future that gives more people access to more things, and redistributes wealth
to those who do not have access to capital. To provide everyone education</p>
