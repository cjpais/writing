    <h1>Future</h1>
<p>The future of how I want to invest depends on <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>I believe that <em>we</em> as collective set of individuals have the power to do
transformative good in the world without the need for centralized power telling
us what to do. I think we have seen the collapse of institutions doing good.</p>
<p>Very few people I meet are happy with their jobs. You don't like selling life
insurance to people who don't need it? No kidding. Maybe we should focus on
preventative healthcare. Researching individualized diets based on
microbiome research.</p>
<p>This is to say, I think with enough people, we can throw our weight behind
truly good things in the world. By doing this we should outweigh the
'bad'/'evil' things.</p>
<p>Ultimately I would like to have a crowdfunded and voted VC fund. To have
enough money to take risks. To have a platform where ideas can be played with
and eventually funded in a collaborative way.</p>
<p>To have experts in every category to bounce ideas off of and see if that idea
is truly good. Ideas are valuable based not on the amount of money they
generate but by the good they do in the world. That good likely will be
rewarded with money.</p>
<p>Cost savings across industry is important, but that is a neutral thing. We
want net good. Not just something financially viable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Evil doesn't have to be an overt act; it can be merely the absence of good. If you have the ability, the resources, and the opportunity to do good and you do nothing, that can be evil</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am continuously refining the ways I want to invest.</p>
<p>But the fundamental is always the same. I want to invest in a better future.
A future looking towards world peace, with less conflict, and sustainable growth</p>
<p>A future that gives more people access to more things, and redistributes wealth
to those who do not have access to capital. To provide everyone education</p>
