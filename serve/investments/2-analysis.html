<p>This really all kicked off with a Friday evening (2/5/2021 ~7:00pm)
conversation with Alex as I was driving to Joshua Tree for a climbing trip.
We had a whole lot more to discuss than financials and investments,
however it became one of the more interesting topics we stumbled upon.</p>
<p>Well this is to say, I've been talking some big game about my investments
this year. It was hard not to do good in these COVID times. A perfect storm
to buy in if you could afford it.</p>
<p>What I did say were two-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can live off of my investments for life</li>
<li>I have had 130% returns this year</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically I mentioned one thing
that might be true. I think that I could live off of my investments for the
rest of my life.</p>
