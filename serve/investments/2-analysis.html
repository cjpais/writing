<p>This really all kicked off with a Friday evening (2/5/2021 ~7:00pm)
conversation with Alex as I was driving to Joshua Tree for a climbing trip.
We had a whole lot more to discuss than financials and investments,
however it became one of the more interesting topics we stumbled upon.</p>
<p>Well this is to say, I've been talking some big game about my investments
this year. It was hard not to do good in these COVID times. A perfect storm
to buy in if you could afford it.</p>
<p>What I did say were two-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can live off of my investments for life</li>
<li>I have had ~100% returns this year</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems these two things make some ears perk. Sure a good amount is in $TSLA
which obviously inflates how well my portfolio has done. However on the whole
I think my strategy is a winning one.</p>
<p>With this said I'd like to review a few aspects of my current portfolio.</p>
<ul>
<li>How well I've done with respect to common market indices
<ul>
<li>Over all time</li>
<li>Over the past year</li>
<li>% Gain Month over month</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Would my investments grow if I take $2000/mo out of them
<ul>
<li>Starting Jan 2020 (only had enough money in to make it viable)</li>
<li>Take an even amount out of all stocks (unrealistic however)
<ul>
<li>Also implies certain % Gain Month over Month which I want to explore</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Holdings:
<ul>
<li>Why I invested in the companies I did</li>
<li>How well diversified I am
<ul>
<li>Plainly obvious I hold too much QCOM as it is</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chart each stock over time that I've held (perc gain over time)</li>
<li>Chart the weight of each stock over time ($ invested * $ value/total invested)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving forward I have a better idea of what I want to invest in. I think this
year made betting very easy. However, the strategy I have chosen already
is outperforming the standard market indices. I expect moving forward it will
only get stronger. So let's move on to the bets I am making.</p>
