<p>This really all kicked off with a Friday evening (2/5/2021 ~7:00pm)
conversation with Alex as I was driving to Joshua Tree for a climbing trip.
We had a whole lot more to discuss than financials and investments,
however it became one of the more interesting topics we stumbled upon.</p>
<p>Well this is to say, I've been talking some big game about my investments
this year. It was hard not to do good in these COVID times. A perfect storm
to buy in if you could afford it.</p>
<p>What I did say were two-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can live off of my investments for life</li>
<li>I have had ~100% returns this year</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems these two things make some ears perk. Sure a good amount is in $TSLA
which obviously inflates how well my portfolio has done. However on the whole
I think my strategy is a winning one.</p>
<p>With this said I'd like to review a few aspects of my current portfolio.</p>
<ul>
<li>How well I've done with respect to common market indices
<ul>
<li>Over all time</li>
<li>Over the past year</li>
<li>Month over month</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Would my investments grow if I take $2000/mo out of them
<ul>
<li>Starting Jan 2020 (only had enough money in to make it viable)</li>
<li>Take an even amount out of all stocks (unrealistic however)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
