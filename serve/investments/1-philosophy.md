  * Should be able to live off my investments for the rest of my life
* No investments opposed to world peace
* No racist organizations

  * Encourage good supply chain ethics even at the expense of profit.
* For tech should value privacy (ideally.)
* No big pharma
* ***Do Good.***
  * Every company should be doing more good for the world than evil
    * Every company may have to do some amount of evil, but this should be minimized.
    * Investments should be made partially in proportion to the seen good v. evil balance
* Open Source and Transparency
  * Yes leaves us open to getting short squeezed
  * But the good we are doing ideally should minimize this risk
    * Need to think about this one more, exactly how this looks at scale.....

Take some risk and bet on a better future.

Business should be geared towards the long term even if sacrificing short term profits. Sustainability. Yvon Chouinard
