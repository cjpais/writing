# Long Future

One thing to review in talking about the long future idea. Am I really
just talking about taxes and a new way to work with tax money? Basically
saying cool, pay into the system and here are all the benefits that
we are going to provide you. This could drive innovation in the US 
again. Give everyone access to AWS like resources run by the gov. Same
for ML. Same for biotech. Etc. etc. Digital is obviously much easier
than physical, but this should stimulate innovation to a different level
and hopefully have it slightly less profit driven? Anyway an interesting
idea. I don't think there is a problem with the current infrastructure
other than it's cost. I think it would be prohibitive for some people
to get the resources they need, and also just complex to understand.
I don't want a calculator to figure how much I can use. I just want 
to pay a simple fee. Please include this in my taxes. This could 
be the next big US infrastructure project. Maybe nationalized cell
service? I mean I would want that personally, and leave the corporations
to innovate and provide better service.
