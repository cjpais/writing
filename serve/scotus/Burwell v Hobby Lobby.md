- Background:
    - Focuses on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The following only covers what is relevant to this case. 
        - RFRA
            - As the title of the bill suggests, it is to ensure that religious freedoms are protected under the law following from the First Amendment
                - Specifically it prohibits the government “ from substantially burdening a person's exercise of religion”
            - Has two provisions
                - The government can only burden religious exercise if there is a compelling governmental interest in doing so
                - The government can only restrict religious practice if it is the "least restrictive means" of achieving the government's goal.
            - There is also the text of “general applicability”
                - So there's a key difference here lurking.
                - There can be laws that specifically target First Amendment Rights and those which don't.
                - Those that don't may still end up restricting First Amendment Rights as they are "generally applicable". That is they are often applied outside of First Amendment Rights.

        - ACA
            - Requires employers to provide "preventative care and screenings" for women without "any cost saving requirements"
            - What "preventative care" means was left up to Health and Human Services (HHS).
                - HHS decided in line with the FDA that non-exempt employers are required to provide coverage for 20 contraceptive methods. Religious organizations are exempt. 
                - Also mentioned is that religious non-profits are effectively exempt as well. The insurance company can exclude contraceptives, but provide payments on the side for contraceptive services.
- Case Summary:
    - Hobby Lobby (a for-profit company) argues that the regulations for contraceptives as provided by HHS violate the RFRA. The court ruled in favor (5-4) of Hobby Lobby. This would allow Hobby Lobby to deny women free access to certain contraceptive methods under their group health insurance plan.
- Majority Opinion (Justice Alito):
    - The regulations provided by HHS violate the *sincerely* held religious beliefs which implies the RFRA is violated.
    - These violations *substantially burden* these companies from exercising religion.
    - Corporations are protected under RFRA
    - Since they are protected under RFRA, now was there a substantial burden placed on the exercise of religion? If there was, was it the "least-restrictive means"
        - 1. If they don't comply as per the law there will be a large financial burden placed on the companies. 
            - cj: why can't they just comply? who gives a shit
        - This is a substantial burden.
        - 2. Was this burden the least restrictive means?
            - No. "There are other ways which congress could ensure that every woman has cost-free access to the particular contraceptives"
                - HHS has done this for religious non-profits already
                - cj: this is true. and could be more a failure of the law itself for not doing enough for women. it may not be the courts decision as they are just examining the law
    - Addressing dissent
        - The holding is specific here. Corporations cannot opt out of any law on the basis of RFRA.
        - Do not hold that corporations can impose "disadvantages"
            - Not providing certain contraceptives is a disadvantage to women. They now have the burden of having a child. 
        - That women will not be impacted. Women still entitled to contraceptives without cost-sharing (as provided by group health insurance).
            - Need to continue to look into: https://www.google.com/search?q=cost+sharing+health+insurance&oq=cost+sharing+health&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i457j0l2j0i22i30l4.3336j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
- Concurring Opinion (Justice Kennedy):
- Dissenting Opinion (Justice Ginsberg):
- My Opinion:
    - Again these are very touchy things when the law is involved. I grew up in a left-leaning household, so I certainly have bias in that direction
    - Trying to ignore that for a moment however. 
    - Perhaps I don't agree with the basis of the argument. 
    - This decision was made on the basis that corporations are people and effectively extend those rights. My issue with this is that corporations form more than one person, and in this case it seems like the corporation held by a few individuals is over to exercise undue influence over their employees. I don't think this makes sense. As a person I have very little influence over your personal freedoms.
        - What can be argued here though is that these personal freedoms are not being imposed upon. A woman can still get out and access contraceptive methods. This is certainly true. But I think then the belief becomes much more political. Do you believe that access to contraceptives is a fundamental human right? I think there is a lot of data to prove the benefits of contraceptives, but there are arguments on both sides. This is where it gets political and is harder to distance myself from my own beliefs. I do believe that every person has the right to be healthy by birth on this planet. I don't think this is an extreme belief. I don't want to wish someone poor health. That's just in bad faith as humans, even if I disagree with that person. 
        - Well as guaranteed by the law they are being imposed upon. If you agree or disagree with the law is a different question. 
        - Is a corporation not being able to exercise it's religious rights really imposing on your freedom? Hmmm
        - Does one person as part of holding a corporation have the power over someone else? Is this something that we agree to? Is this not slavery in a modern context?
    - Can corporations operate on religious values? I think yes. That is not a flaw, and for some it could be a virtue. However as a result, a corporation should not be able to limit someone else's rights as a result of their religious beliefs.
