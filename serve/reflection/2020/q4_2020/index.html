    <h1>Q4 2020 (Sept - December)</h1>
<h2>Into the Unknown</h2>
<p><img src="red_rock.jpeg" alt="Red Rock, NV. Oct 2020. First Climbing Trip" /></p>
<p>Wow. What a wild 4 months. 4 months of the unknown.</p>
<p>Below will be a summary of everything that I worked on or did during this time. However since this is a reflection I’d like to tackle that up front. However it was not written until after everything was done.</p>
<p>There is a theme that runs through this document. It is one of play, but also one of distraction.</p>
<h2>Quitting Qualcomm</h2>
<p>Yep. I quit my job without much of a plan. Initially I thought</p>
<h2>An Adventure in Openness</h2>
<h2>Finding a DB (First Week)</h2>
<p>Since one of the big things I want to work on is private data, I was trying to figure out a good way to manage all of my private data. Initially my plan was to write my own DB. However, this idea was quickly abandoned in favor of Postgres. However I didn’t want to use SQL directly. I’ve found it effective but always a bit of a pain.</p>
<p>I’d been looking in this area for a while, and eventually it looked like GraphQL and Hasura were my best option to augment Postgres. Once all set up I migrated my Podcast and Notes apps to use this DB in addition to the CoreData DB they were using.</p>
<p>Once this was done, I got thinking about another project. To display my financials publicly.</p>
<h2>Conversations</h2>

<h2>RBG Passing</h2>
<p>The death of RBG was tragic to hear, for the future of the Supreme Court, minorities (yes! not just Women) rights, and much more. One of my friends is going to law school, and one of her favorite classes was Constitutional Law. I asked her what her favorite RBG cases were so I could read the opinions. I read 3 cases intending to write about each. I managed to do so just for Shelby County v Holder</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Shelby County v Holder</em> - [<a href="../../../scotus/shelby%20county%20v%20holder.pdf">marked up pdf</a>] [<a href="../../../scotus/Shelby%20County%20v.%20Holder.md">my analysis</a>]</li>
<li><em>Burwell v Hobby Lobby</em></li>
<li><em>US v Virginia</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Financials (aka. <a href="https://burrito.place">burrito.place</a>)</h2>
<p>One of the more interesting things to me is the idea of transparency.</p>
<p>Beyond just transparency, with this project I wanted to play around with the idea of directly selling my data as well as creating an exchange.</p>
<ul>
<li>Transparency</li>
<li>Selling Data
<ul>
<li>Giving up Data for Discount (effectively selling your data)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adjusting price based on wealth. Flattening wealth inequality curve</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the main reasons this never got finished was that my main two credit cards were not easy to get data from. This effectively killed the project. It was certainly possible to get my data from CapitalOne (see my analysis), but I don’t think it was worth the time to continue to engineer such a fragile solution. Beyond this, my Apple Card is the only other card I use, which doesn’t look like you can pull data easily from (c’mon Apple). Neither were integrated with Plaid at the time of writing which was what I was planning on using.</p>
<p>While this project never quite got off the ground, I still think it is quite an interesting concept. I would like to revisit this at some point. Wether it be for financial data, or any of my data. This is one aspect of the technology industry I think could use some change and has lots of potential.</p>
