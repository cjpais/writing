# TODO

* Analysis and Philosophy
* Pretty UI
* Move to TS and Preact
* Table of Transactions
* Beautiful Assets over Time Graph
  * Maybe the same for value, to see it accelerate
* More Charts
  * Month over Month % gain
    * In comparison to common indicies
    * And maybe any stock
  * Chart all my stocks performance in %
    * Do the same but adjusted relative to my investment in them
* Be able to remove stocks from portfolio
* Podcast Record Audio
* Remove dependency on `investments.txt` and infer from `.csv`
* Static and Dynamic API Versioning
  * Static mainly for the site
  * Dynamic for moving forward with more investors
    * Including graphing arbitrary stock that I don't own
  * Come up with better way of getting information or build out own platform/API
* WebSocketSync
  * Client
  * Server
  * Computer DNS, where you can talk to this computer with a limited protocol
    * Identification is key here, must be able to identify
    * This should allow some level of private, public, friends, similar to Upspin
  * Create a very simple V0 prototype, where I can keep my git or home directory in sync.. My git directory will be my new home directory. Eventually it will replace my actual home directory, by just directly syncing it.
  * Eventually this can be a distributed file system of sorts as well
* Transformer based Speech to Text for Podcast Transcription
* Daily based on my stream data (which eventually needs to be merged into Home, but maybe not all synced.)
* Build filter for stream (filter out podcast lmao)
* Build dev stream into `Streamable` library
* Need to work on basic ML tasks, even if just going through existing. 
  * Just need to dip my toes in and get a feel. 
  * I think after next week this is what we will need to do.
  * Maybe also spend one day on podcast audio
* Daily gets generated from writing, stream, podcast, etc.
  * Really we want a weekly and monthly too.
  * Basically a really quick way to look at the past and digest it in a comic book like way. A story.
    * Should get WeiWei involved in this to see if she would have some interest.
  * want photo backup on the server as well, run via the websocketsync
  * Basically more personal data infrastructure stuff
* Thoughts should be able to be linked directly on twitter


* Start a podcast just asking questions, posing questions, ideating
* Tag infrastructure, maybe similar to mymind but something i would actually use
