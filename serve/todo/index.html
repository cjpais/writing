    <h1>TODO</h1>
<ul>
<li>Analysis and Philosophy</li>
<li>Pretty UI</li>
<li>Move to TS and Preact</li>
<li>Table of Transactions</li>
<li>Beautiful Assets over Time Graph
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>More Charts
<ul>
<li>Month over Month % gain</li>

<ul>
<li>Do the same but adjusted relative to my investment in them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Podcast Record Audio</li>
<li>Remove dependency on <code>investments.txt</code> and infer from <code>.csv</code></li>
<li>Static and Dynamic API Versioning
<ul>
<li>Static mainly for the site</li>
<li>Dynamic for moving forward with more investors
<ul>
<li>Including graphing arbitrary stock that I don't own</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Come up with better way of getting information or build out own platform/API</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WebSocketSync
<ul>
<li>Client</li>
<li>Server</li>
<li>Computer DNS, where you can talk to this computer with a limited protocol
<ul>
<li>Identification is key here, must be able to identify</li>
<li>This should allow some level of private, public, friends, similar to Upspin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a very simple V0 prototype, where I can keep my git or home directory in sync.. My git directory will be my new home directory. Eventually it will replace my actual home directory, by just directly syncing it.</li>
<li>Eventually this can be a distributed file system of sorts as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Transformer based Speech to Text for Podcast Transcription</li>
<li>Daily based on my stream data (which eventually needs to be merged into Home, but maybe not all synced.)</li>
<li>Build filter for stream (filter out podcast lmao)</li>
</ul>
