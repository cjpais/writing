    <h1>Thursday December 17, 2020</h1>
<p>Good climbing this morning.</p>
<p>Took me a while to get to my computer and get going, but it is what it is. Now it is time to do some thinking.</p>
<p>One thing coming out of the shower is a long term project. The long term project. The next internet. An incremental but important change. Addressing the concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we provide universal access to the internet for free without censorship?
<ul>
<li>Paywalls?</li>
<li>Just like buying a book from a store you might need to pay, but is this a cost too high for most people?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do people get paid fairly for content creation (music, video, etc)
<ul>
<li>On their own terms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do people live in a world driven more and more by technology
<ul>
<li>How can people be paid for having and contributing to a digital presence?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do we lower the friction of having an internet presence, being paid and paying. Make it easier than a credit card.</li>
<li>How can the internet be used to bring together and create space for opposite points of view. Just to be heard, not scoffed at.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway. These are some of the long term things to think about and work on. This will be a piece coming out. Perhaps in multiple parts, perhaps in one long.</p>
<p>Thinking about the possibilities of the future of computing in general too.</p>
<p>Anyway things for today include</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix multiple input bug, make sure columns appear correct to sort (going into DB)
<ul>
<li>fix: strip spacing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>add pending groups to the dashboard
<ul>
<li>pending groups endpoint</li>
</ul></li>
<li>replicate the group page for pending, but add additional button to send the email out to the group
<ul>
<li>endpoint to send the email once good</li>
</ul></li>
<li>change grouping logic
<ul>
<li>if the email has not been sent yet, then group the people, but allow more to be added through the algo</li>
<li>group can only be formed once</li>
</ul></li>
<li>plugin for vscode instead of python script</li>
<li>review jons comments</li>
<li>overview</li>
</ul>
