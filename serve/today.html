    <h1>Tuesday, March 30, 2021</h1>
<p>Day started out a little slow, but quickly ramped up for me. Waking up this
morning was a bit challenging. Slept in an extra 30 min.</p>
<p>Got tea/smoothie/coffee with Kristen and Dave. Some great convo this morning,
will probably be writing more about it on <a href="buzzard.life">buzzard.life</a></p>
