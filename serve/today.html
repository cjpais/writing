    <h1>Thursday, February 4, 2021</h1>
<p>WEEEEE surf at Law Street was fun. Got crushed but always
a fantastic time. Leave with a smile and a great start
to the day. Fuck yeah.</p>
<p>Daniel conversation very good. Need to think about motivations
and decentralized architecture. CRDT's for sure. My brain is fried
and emotions all over the place.</p>
