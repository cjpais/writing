    <h1>Monday November 30th, 2020</h1>
<p>Working on some QR designs, really just playing around a little bit. Might end up making this some kind of JS customizer or something lol. Definitely want to allow gyms to pick their preferred code for bouldering and sport.</p>
<p><img src="qr_designs.png" /></p>
<p>Watched a little bit of Visa’s advice for people in their 20’s. Journaled a little on this.</p>
<p>Now going to work on a few articles I am writing about Apple. Today particularly the M1 and AR.</p>
