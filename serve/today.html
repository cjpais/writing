<h2>Programming Education</h2>
<p>Thinking a little bit this morning about what a curriculum for teaching kids
how to program would look like. Specifically something that is fun and
encourages them to keep learning more.</p>
<p>For me how I learned most of my programming and computer skills was
through Minecraft. I think this is something that could still be a
valuable teaching tool today, and hopefully keep kids engaged as
well</p>
<p>I have some skills I would want to focus on.</p>
<ul>
<li>UNIX
<ul>
<li>basics: cd, ls, cp, mv, nano/vim, ssh</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Programming
<ul>
<li>Variables</li>
<li>Loops</li>
<li>Conditional Logic/Boolean Logic</li>
<li>Interfacing with API and Documentation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
<h4>UNIX</h4>
<p>I think one way to learn UNIX would be to set up a minecraft server and have friends
join. And then start to do more complicated things like add plugins to the server
and things like this.</p>
<h4>Programming</h4>
<p>Explainations of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud Architecture</li>
</ul>
