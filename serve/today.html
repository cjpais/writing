    <h1>Wednesday, February 10, 2021</h1>
<p>Good morning!</p>
<p>It's been nice so far, got through another 60 pages or so of <em>A Promised Land</em>.
Cooked breakfast which was simple and good. Mushrooms, veggies and eggs. Great.</p>
<p>I wrote down some things yesterday which would be good to review. Some relating
to the Schmachtenberger Portal Episode.</p>
<p>Looking back at Feb 5. Really would like to get some old school floral stuff.
That is for sure a vibe and on the radar, but not important to do now.</p>
<p>Other is talking with Alex and investing. Really the thought is if people are
actually willing to put money into me investing their money I might be willing
to do that. I will need to come up with a better system to manage that money.
Specifically one where they can view it digitally. With some of the same factors
and abilities I am building into my own tool.</p>
<p>This also gets me thinking more on the existential risk. It seems at some point
we will need a new system however while we are working with this one we should
be directing investments into things that will be helpful regardless of the
system. This should do well in the long run. I think crypto is a big asset in
this domain as well.</p>
<p>Another thought would be really, how can you make music payment truly decentralized?
Is this a task that I can legitimately take up? I think it very well could be, but
will need to think of the specifics, but I bet I can write an ethereum contract
that allows for this. The only problem is piracy I guess? And probably getting
some authentication key that identifies you as streaming that piece of music.
Possibly can even be done at the granular level? Seconds? As you recieve the stream
you are essentially purchasing that stream. Does this also allow you to purchase
the music outright if you don't want to pay the streaming fee? After a certain
number of streams do you have some 'ownership' of that media? Or does it always
remain in the hands of the artist? It should remain in the hands of the artist.</p>
<p>On Schmachtenberger: Look into Strategic Global Solutions, Foundation for
Conscious Evolution, Civilization Emerging, Consilience Project.</p>
<p>I think mainly in terms of RethinkX one of the big things to focus on is the nature
of distributed systems. Specifically how can we make solar more easily accessible to
everyone and even build a grid between neighbors? That makes us more robust and
potentially allows for exchange of resources simply. This would be a similar
question for food production as well. Can it be done en mass at the local level
like energy production can? Same with internet. All of these things seem quite
important.</p>
<p>Who is Peter Thiel? Co-Founder of PayPal. Basically a VC guy now. Has the
Founder's Fund. This seems like an interesting VC. Potentially ways to pitch
the CBRS idea lol. Looks like he has done some sketchy stuff (aka not good
for the greater humanity), and I don't like Palantir on the outside.
However it would be good to listen to him on a podcast. Added him to my queue,
on ep 1 of The Portal and on Tim Ferris.</p>
<p>Basically all the areas the Founder's Fund is interested in and similarly
RethinkX are the primary areas to invest in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Space</li>
<li>Biotech</li>
<li>Next Gen Agriculture</li>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Computing</li>
<li>Internet</li>
</ul>
<p>After reading their 'manifesto' or whatever, makes it clear to me. If I wanted
to build a distributed LTE/5G network it would be more than possible. We could
build a properly distributed and mesh internet on a global scale.</p>
<p>I did also do some writing about what I want in the podcast app. To be more concrete.</p>
<p>Voice to Text is AWFUL ON MY IPHONE. I think it really would be useful to train
a neural net specifically to recognize my voice. I think I can probably
use Otter for some of it then correct it, and feed that into my own net.</p>
<p>So podcasts. Have direct note taking capability within app. Be able to dictate
a note on the podcast. No typing initially. Also with bookmarks be able to set
a start and stop clipping method.</p>
<p>Okay so a few big things are coming out of these interests.</p>
<ul>
<li>Investing
<ul>
<li>Petro Dollar</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Podcast</li>
<li>Machine Learning (Speech to Text)</li>
<li>CBRS</li>
</ul>
<p>I think these should be the focus for some time and start to knock them
down. CBRS is the biggest one and probably need to think more deeply
about what this looks like and actually set up a LTE base station with
minimal equipment and see what is possible.</p>
<p>The financials thing is much more interesting that Austin brought up.</p>
<p>Before this lets set some buys for crypto and then go from there.
Okay I set buys. ~$3000 worth. ETH and BTC, about 50/50 split between
the two. Let's see. Pretty low buys :)</p>
<p>Okay interesting afternoon. Sold the MBP to investment bankers GF.
But got to meet the investment banker Omar Gomez. Was interesting to
talk to him. Mentioned the dollar is more the petro-dollar than anything
else. Very interesting to know. I think understanding the implications
of the petro dollar will be important to understand, however I don't think
I have a good grasp on it currently.</p>
<p>This is also not to mention, I will need to understand what the US
being in debt really means. Also what are the implications of renewables
taking on the current oil driven economy? What happens with China?
These are questions that deserve more of my mental attention I think.</p>
<p>Beyond this also want to diversify my portfolio to incorporate more asset
classes. Gold. Crypto. Tech. Bio. Materials. Energy. Etc. Etc.</p>
<p>The main question however still remains unanswered. Why do I care about
this $ value attached to my name? Do I value this at all? Does it mean
anything or is it purely a means for me to get around in the world?
I mean it doesn't inherently add any value to me.</p>
<p>Does it even matter to publish the graphs that I am working on? I mean
yeah sure, but at the same time I don't want to make a big deal out
of it, it's more an interesting thing to put out there to see performance.
I think it is interesting to show, but there's not a lot of value. Am I
just trying to show, wow, look at this big guy here, he can invest money.
But that is not something I really care about. I mean yes, but I really
care more about investing money into something positive that will make
the world better. Is that what I am doing here? Hard for me to say. Yes
my decisions are being driven by that motivation, but ultimately having
the $ is nice. I do want a house and I can't ignore that either. But
how much of my time is it really worth to put in?</p>
