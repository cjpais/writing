    <h1>Tuesday December 2nd, 2020</h1>
<p>Good day but there is never enough time for everything. Quickly capturing before sleeping.</p>
<p>Spent most of the morning trying to figure out how to get photogrammetry software to work. Lots of manually compiling code. Eventually said fuck it I need a CUDA GPU to run MeshRoom. Went to the Geeks Candy Shop and got a Tesla K20 for $40. Sweet. I needed something with CUDA capability &gt;= 3.0. This was 3.5. I guess this is the same architecture as a GTX780? Long in the tooth, but fine to experiment with for now. Can return it if I find a better way to do this completely on mobile using point clouds generated from ARKit.</p>
<p>That took most of the morning until about 2. Including getting replacement sunglasses and going to the grocery store (I’m not allowed to eat out during the week anymore).</p>
<p>Just was playing with QR code designs after this. Lots of playing. Needs to be a certain size. Also trying to auto generate colors for it via chroma.js which took a lot of time. Not happy with the results. Might manually just pick colors and stick them in a constant because it’s easier.</p>
<p>Things to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>More QR codes</li>
<li>Apple article. Writing round 2</li>
<li>ARKit Point Cloud Generation and Visualization</li>
<li>Directory structure and VSCode plugin so I don’t go insane.</li>
</ul>
<p>Python 3.9 fucked up my life. Accidentally installed. Back to 3.8.5</p>
