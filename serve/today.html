    <h1>Wednesday, January 27, 2021</h1>
<p>Weew what a morning. Got a bunch of misc tasks out of the way, and now have some time to think.
Did finish <em>Entangled Life</em> which was great. Didn't realize how close I was to the end of the book, but sweet.</p>
<p>I really only put out a couple of tasks out for today.</p>
<ul>
<li>Summarize yesterdays writing</li>
<li>Create ML projects matching some aspects of what I want to learn (this could be doing it backwards, but fine)</li>
</ul>
<p>If these go quickly, the podcast <em>The Self Employment Meta-Game</em> has been interesting so far.
It also had a question which is worth examining.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;What is a story of your life that you're compelled by&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Another thing that we should get done before this one is to write about where we are with the computer project.</p>
<h2>Summarizing</h2>
<p>Comes down to a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Think big
<ul>
<li>World Peace</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Need to learn ML (interest in AGI)</li>
<li>Reduce Scope</li>
<li>I would like to be in a position of influence, while maintaining a healthy lifestyle balance. Tell me it can't be done.</li>
</ul>
<h2>ML Learning</h2>
<p>Looking to tackle learning in a few ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to understand language models.</li>
<li>Want to understand labelers (video, audio, text)</li>
<li>Want to understand transformer networks and their purpose</li>
<li>Want to know pivotal moments/major advancements in AI tech</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it makes sense to start with labelers.
So the projects for this seem to be relatively straightforward and obvious</p>
<ul>
<li>Speech Recognition -&gt; Text
<ul>
<li>Then labeling or generating overall context of this in tags
<ul>
<li>This implies generating tags from text, this could be a challenge.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Overall goal to transcribe podcast text with relatively high level of accuracy
<ul>
<li>Ideally with timestamps. Word and time level recognition. =&gt; good input data</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AR Video -&gt; Boxes and labels (computer vision problem)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we have the labelers down (data generation), I think it will then
be important to understand how we can actually access the data.</p>
<p>So this will probably need to be some kind of transformer based language
model similar to GPT-3.</p>
<p>Before diving into any of this I think we should find some course sylibi and
see what they want me to read.</p>
