    <h1>Tuesday, March 30, 2021</h1>
<p>Day started out a little slow, but quickly ramped up for me. Waking up this
morning was a bit challenging. Slept in an extra 30 min.</p>
<p>Got tea/smoothie/coffee with Kristen and Dave. Some great convo this morning,
will probably be writing more about it on <a href="buzzard.life">buzzard.life</a></p>
<p>Also went back to Fink's house to work on the surfboard more. Was good to catch
up with him. I worked mostly on getting the surface of the board ready for hot
coating. Using solarez to patch what I needed before doing the final coat.
I am still unsure if the board is going to be watertight. The fin boxes
are pretty trash on the board and not sure how I am going to fix them
at this point (without spending a lot of time). I think it's possible to
continue to patch them with solarez, but I am not sure if it will be worth
it or not.</p>
<p>When I got home I wanted to finish up the Elixir stuff left off from last night.
Was really struggling with concurrency. Mostly because I wasn't sure how to map
my mental model of what I wanted to achieve into Elixir. When searching more about
concurrency, I quickly found the Exercism blog post with the solution. However I
didn't like the model they chose to work with. They merged all the texts into
one list then got the characters and split them into working groups.</p>
<p>This is fine and definitely works. But for some reason this method feels like
cheating to me. I definitely did not want to use this method. I wanted to
concurrently process each text individually. I feel that this makes more
intuitive sense when reading the problem statement. Perhaps it is not
the most efficient, but as a newbie, both to concurrency and Elixir
it seemed the most obvious way to go.</p>
<p>To go this way initially I wanted a worker pool. This would try to ensure
that workers were being used to capacity. I think in the solution above
due to how they used <code>ceil</code> there could be an under-utilization of workers.
Sometimes with workers not even being assigned. That also didn't seem to fit
the problem statement very well.</p>
<p>I tried to build my own pool but that was too heavy of a solution. The good
thing about the blog post was it mentioned <code>Task.async_stream</code>. This was
a great fit for the solution I was looking for still. However I still needed
to limit the workers. Fortunately it has <code>:maximum_concurrency</code> as an option.
That made it rather easy to make sure I had the correct number of workers
(and hopefully maximally utilize them). I am not sure the underlying scheduling
algorithm, but assume it to be more optimal than the blog solution.</p>
<p>With this figured out it was mainly a challenge to use <code>Enum.reduce</code> to actually
merge the maps being returned asynchronously. After lots of documentation reading
and experimenting in <code>iex</code> I had a better grasp of what was going on.</p>
<p>Pattern matching is still somewhat unintuitive for me. I am not quite sure when
to use it when programming in Elixir, however I think I would need to use the
language more to really take advantage of it.</p>
<p>Overall a better learning day than yesterday. Really just needed something of
a break and food in my system to work effectively. Turns out doing 10 hour
stints is not always sustainable when you are learning about something new.</p>
<p>Anyway, maybe at some point I will write that pooling mechanism I would want.</p>
<p>Looking forward to tomorrow. Cheers</p>
