    <h1>Thursday December 17, 2020</h1>
<p>Good climbing this morning.</p>
<p>Took me a while to get to my computer and get going, but it is what it is. Now it is time to do some thinking.</p>
<p>One thing coming out of the shower is a long term project. The long term project. The next internet. An incremental but important change. Addressing the concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we provide universal access to the internet for free without censorship?
<ul>
<li>Paywalls?</li>
<li>Just like buying a book from a store you might need to pay, but is this a cost too high for most people?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do people get paid fairly for content creation (music, video, etc)
<ul>
<li>On their own terms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do people live in a world driven more and more by technology
<ul>
<li>How can people be paid for having and contributing to a digital presence?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do we lower the friction of having an internet presence, being paid and paying. Make it easier than a credit card.</li>
<li>How can the internet be used to bring together and create space for opposite points of view. Just to be heard, not scoffed at.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway. These are some of the long term things to think about and work on. This will be a piece coming out. Perhaps in multiple parts, perhaps in one long.</p>
<p>Thinking about the possibilities of the future of computing in general too.</p>
<p>Anyway things for today include</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix multiple input bug, make sure columns appear correct to sort (going into DB)
<ul>
<li>fix: strip spacing</li>
<li><em>done.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>add pending groups to the dashboard
<ul>
<li>pending groups endpoint</li>
</ul></li>
<li>replicate the group page for pending, but add additional button to send the email out to the group
<ul>
<li>endpoint to send the email once good</li>
</ul></li>
<li>change grouping logic
<ul>
<li>if the email has not been sent yet, then group the people, but allow more to be added through the algo</li>
<li>group can only be formed once</li>
</ul></li>
<li>plugin for vscode instead of python script</li>
<li>review jons comments</li>
<li>overview</li>
</ul>
<p>welp. did everything for Meera. Then I got sidetracked. Was about 7 hours of work, slightly less.</p>
<p>Did not write the vscode plugin. Did not review Jon’s comments.</p>
<p>However I did start thinking about all the things that I can give. I think I need to make a list. Maybe this will be a more effective way to move forward. Think about all the things right now which I can give to someone else that can help them. And not do it in a half-ass way. But do something really that can help if explained right.</p>
<p>The most obvious one to me right now would be TypeScript + React. Plus an explanation of “the stack”. Perhaps even previous stacks. LAMP… All these things. At the level of someone who knows how to program, but maybe is unfamiliar with these particular environment and things you can do in them (namely functional programming constructs)</p>
<p>Tomorrow AM will be exploring this.</p>
