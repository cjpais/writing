    <h1>Monday, March 29, 2021</h1>
<p>So far an interesting day. Tried to get some surfboard shaping space at
Maketory. Will have to see if this works out, there is a shipping container
that could be a good space perhaps for even two people. Will have to see.
Hopefully the price is good.</p>
<p>On another note, started working with GWR (Geographically Weighted Regression)
to analyze expected AirBnB prices in Berlin. This eventually will be targeted
for estimating rent prices across San Diego. However I will say it seems like
the expected price as outputted by the regression is quite off.</p>
<p>From what I can tell it is giving almost all weight to the geographically
close neighbors, but not taking into account the other important features.
I am not quite sure how to correct for this yet. This is something I would
like to discuss with Kevin and see if he has any insight that I do not. I
am also curious if I can naively do some kind of ensemble technique and see
if that helps or not.</p>
<p>I have a feeling I will have to spend a lot more time with the data to get
something meaningful out of it. I was hoping the machine learning techniques
would reduce the search space dramatically. I think that it should, but I
don't have the right insight into the problem or the space yet to really
grasp.</p>
<p>I am thinking about taking a break from this problem and instead moving
to finish up the Elixir challenges on 1729.com. At the worst I learn
more about Elixir and the best case I also win $100 of BTC.</p>
